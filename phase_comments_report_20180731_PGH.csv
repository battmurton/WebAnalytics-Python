"how-can-pittsburgh-better-utilize-its-alleyways-and-lesser-used-thoroughfares",,"For clarification, when I say traffic, I am referring to all types of traffic, not just automobile. Automobiles already have the ability to use alleys and side streets, and do so frequently to avoid congestion on main roads. My concern is that if the city further reduces automobile capacity on main roads, there will be more congestion, and more and more automobiles and trucks will use side streets and alleys instead. I think we both agree that would be a negative consequence. So maybe the city should instead try and redirect bike and foot traffic off of main roads, and onto side streets and alleys. That is what I was trying to get at in my original contribution, but it's difficult in 140 characters.

And in response to your concern about automobiles &quot;taking over&quot;, they are already the predominant mode of transportation in Pittsburgh, and that will only become more pronounced as self-driving and fuel-saving technologies advance. Building a better transportation infrastructure in Pittsburgh will depend on accommodating for what people will do instead of deciding what we think they should do.","declan.ogrady902","Declan","O'Grady","declan.ogrady90@gmail.com","USER","2018-06-05 13:12:48",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/pittsburgh/explore/how-can-pittsburgh-better-utilize-its-alleyways-and-lesser-used-thoroughfares/comments#!c-70efdf2ec9b086079795c442636b55fb"

"how-can-pittsburgh-better-utilize-its-alleyways-and-lesser-used-thoroughfares","Many alleyways are currently being utilized as low car traffic bike routes. If those alleyways were prioritized for bike traffic and marked as such they could make for strong bike corridors. That doesn't mean we should stop adding bike corridors to more direct roads though. Encouraging bicycle use is a top way to reduce gridlock!

Having said that, the best way to reduce traffic on main roads is to get people out of cars. That means bicycling and transit use has to look like an attractive alternative which means driving has to look unattractive. Right now our society is set up to emphasize driving and deemphasize taking the bus/T.

"the-existing-dedicated-bus-rapid-transit-brt-routes-should-be-made-accessible-and-safe-to-pedestrians-and-cyclists",,"There are a lot of buses during rush hour, but not all day. It's definitely a great choice for buses, and many of the buses are crowded. They could still stand to increase bus frequency. Unfortunately the buses get stuck in downtown congestion when they leave the busway. And much of the land surrounding the busway stops could be more built up as transit-oriented development. The areas around Negley Station and Herron Stations, for example, are way underutilized; and they could use one more stop in the Strip (e.g. at 21st St) and perhaps Bloomfield (e.g. Baum) to support the new UPMC developments.
Also, once Healthy Ride expands, I'll be able to get to and from the busway from home super fast from where I live in Highalnd Park (sometimes I take my bike with me but for those times I don't have it, it would be great).

It would have helped with transportation to downtown restaurants/shops, to the north shore for concerts/sports, and even to the South Hills for shopping. Also, the hospitals in Oakland serve as employment for many around the city. As I have worked for UPMC while in school, I know many of my coworkers would have benefitted from this transportation to and from where they reside. Another location would be East Liberty. This is a growing neighborhood with many new housing opportunities and businesses. Between these locations are areas like Shadyside and Bloomfield that would be within walking distance of the stops. As there is no longer a grocery store in Oakland, many need to get to these other neighborhoods just to get their essentials.

I think we need to build a lot more support for transit before we can start making serious infrastructure investments.

"self-driving-vehicles","Hi Karen. I'm speaking as a general analyst and not on behalf of any PGH-based companies.

The status of self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh is that they are still in R&amp;D, albeit often testing on public roads as you've probably seen. Aptiv, Uber, and Argo (Ford) have the most prominent operations as far as I know.

While these companies certainly have a degree of advantage given their software's familiarity with PGH streets (and residents), the short-term opportunity for an autonomous vehicle solution -- such as a shuttle or taxi service along dedicated routes -- could be approached just as easily by any competing company with advanced self-driving tech.

I say that because such projects have already been implemented elsewhere in the U.S. and abroad. Most of these trials could be expanded to Pittsburgh seamlessly, at least in 3 out of the 4 seasons. A short list of such initiatives:
- Google/Waymo: limited range on-demand taxi service in Arizona
- Voyage: on-demand taxi service in two very large planned communities
- Aptiv (formerly Delphi): limited range on-demand taxi service in Las Vegas
- Numerous companies: 6-12 passenger shuttle service at school campuses, shopping areas, etc.

Note that of those trials mentioned, only Google's is running without a safety driver. Based on the criteria for this City Of Tomorrow Challenge, the presence of a driver in something like a one-passenger taxi would bring questionable short-term value. But a shuttle service with a safety driver is a reasonable idea today, as is any service where a company claims they've advanced their technology enough to require no employee in the vehicle (a la Google.)

Long story short: self-driving tech could be useful to Pittsburgh residents today if we can make a compelling case that either:
A) We are open to the risk/benefit of trialing taxi services with no safety driver on-board
B) We can identify areas and use cases within the city where passenger shuttles could be beneficial, with the assumption that those shuttles would have an employee on-board in the short-term, and eventually mature the technology so that it no longer requires the 1:1 driver-vehicle ratio.

If you have any ideas or evidence to support those two points, this is a great place to offer them up! For perspective, I would suggest that today's most viable autonomous vehicle solutions run in scenarios where the potential for conflict (with vehicles or pedestrians) is minimal. You can argue for giving such vehicles dedicated rights-of-way, closing off certain streets to car traffic, running them in areas where people are incentivized to play nice (like corporate campuses), or operating them at slow speeds in areas not typically traveled by vehicles (like university campuses and parks.)",,"mitch","Mitch","Turck","mitch@modernthings.net","USER","2018-06-07 20:53:32",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/pittsburgh/explore/self-driving-vehicles/comments#!c-202cb962ac59075b964b07152d234b70"

"opportunity-lost","Hi Brent. The problem that personal transit services (taxis, Uber, etc.) are struggling to solve for you is called dead-heading, or empty trips.

If a taxi is requested on-demand to take someone to the airport, that request is usually filled because -- despite the lengthy trip to a remote location -- it is very likely there will be another passenger at that destination who will request a trip back to a fairly populated area.

On rare occasions when that doesn't happen, the taxi company is forced to drive back towards civilization on their own dime and time. Effectively what happened is that the taxi company just provided the first passenger with a 50% discount on the service -- not a sustainable business model by any measure.

As a resident located in a remote area who is being asked to pay what seems an unreasonable amount of money for a taxi/Uber, the cost is directly related to that wasted economy of driving out to your location without a passenger in the vehicle who is paying for the trip.

This is probably not new information to you, but I mention it because dead-heading is one of the biggest issues in developing transportation services, as it involves physical and economic constraints that seem inescapable. Conventional planners would probably tell you the obvious solution is for you to move to a home with higher demand for transit access.

That said, for the purposes of this Challenge, you could make a more effective case by helping software developers understand how to better quantify people in your position, in hopes that there may be significant demand out there that is currently ignored or too splintered to be identified as a pattern.

But to take it further, look at the flip side of the empty trip: empty seats. You could look into businesses who operate in the Donegal area and see if they have frequent needs for transporting goods. It could turn out that a Donegal florist is delivering into the city multiple times a day using an SUV with three empty seats. That could be you and your wife in those seats! It's the lack of shared information that prevents such efficiencies, so there's potential for mutual benefit between you, the florist, and the city if you can unearth such information.",,"mitch","Mitch","Turck","mitch@modernthings.net","USER","2018-06-07 21:30:40",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/pittsburgh/explore/opportunity-lost/comments#!c-c8ffe9a587b126f152ed3d89a146b445"

"opportunity-lost",,"Data sharing for commercial schedules and routes is something that the Amazons (and Fords) of the world will be looking to promote over the next decade, as the concept of mobility migrates towards resource efficiency. Projects like Uber EATS already do this to some extent, ingesting a business' transportation demand and plugging it into a driver's route to minimize dead-heading between passenger fares.

What would be new, and could possibly be undertaken during this COTC, is the development of an open data platform wherein any local business could offer up its transit patterns as well as any capacity it might have to carry passengers. From that, we could build an app to connect businesses and individuals in order to reduce costs for both parties and open up transit solutions to people like Brent. Doing the legwork to bring businesses together on an open data platform like this would fare well as a blueprint for other cities and larger corporations who, again, will certainly be getting into something along these lines in the future.

To your point, I think individual consumers such as Brent would merely engage with this platform like they would any on-demand rideshare app, albeit one that provides arrival estimates in hours or days rather than minutes. That end user-facing app (and its route optimization logic) has already been built by numerous entities, including Uber who would likely have an interest in this project -- so, the main hurdle I see here (apart from insurance and privacy issues involved in putting a civilian in a commercial vehicle) is getting the data from local businesses who may be unwilling or unable to share transit data effectively.

It's certainly harder than it sounds, to be fair. Perhaps to aid small &amp; medium businesses who have no reliable logistics data to offer, we could incentivize them to allow location beacons to be placed in the vehicles. Doing so would give engineers the opportunity to identify travel patterns and return trip opportunities which could then be plugged into platform.

Where folks like <Ubrentbuswell><Brent Buswell>&nbsp;could kickstart this is by reaching out to local businesses to see if they have frequent and/or regular shipping routes locally... and whether they'd have an interest in picking up civilians along those routes as a means of cutting their delivery costs. A healthy list of businesses supporting the idea and offering to provide logistics data would go a long way as a start.","mitch","Mitch","Turck","mitch@modernthings.net","USER","2018-06-08 05:35:40","2018-06-08 05:40:09","https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/pittsburgh/explore/opportunity-lost/comments#!c-013d407166ec4fa56eb1e1f8cbe183b9"

"eliminating-congestion-with-support-from-our-storied-past",,"Good Morning Katie,

Several years ago my best friend was an engineer for Bombardier - there was from what I heard talk of a private company purchasing the rights, updating, and consolidating it into a light rail system - but, from what I was told it fell flat due to non-alignment of private and government entities on rights to ownership. 

The data is publically available - if you take a look at it if someone could whether it be government, or private consolidate the rights you could quickly turn it into a light rail system at low cost to a commuter, or tax payer.  To me its un-used, and offers our city a huge opportunity - just need the right leadership to get it moving.

Its incredible how much congestion can be relieved by light rail. Reston,VA a suburb of Washington, D.C.  gained Metro access in 2013 the Metro was extended with the grey line - first day in use took 15,000 cars off the highway. 

The data is there to support a business plan for this with Pittsburgh - it would be hard to argue how lucrative and beneficial it would be to the city, private, and public parties if engaged. A formal research docket would overwhelmingly show in the data,  NPV on capital expenditures for purchase and renovation in the green. I could put together a research docket presenting the statistical demand/financial findings, and forecast the 10 year linear. But, would need to know my sweat equity wouldn’t go to waste - need significant leadership to make this happen from government, or private entity - there are several companies that own the un-used industrial rail so there would be a huge need for leadership to get it done.

Probably not the answer you were hoping for, but I hope someone really does take a shot at this its a huge opportunity for the city to alleviate congestion at a low cost.

I would say lone voice in the wilderness! A lot of discussion of it among friends, and research into the data from a  curiosity perspective. 

Would love support on this! I’m willing to do a formal research docket if I have government, or private industry leadership support. It to me is just an incredible opportunity for the city, especially on the upswing of growth we are having.

May even be able to turn my research in to part dissertation work as I start my doctorate in the fall! 

Hope someone in leadership in the city of Pittsburgh, or Private Industry supports this idea!

"eliminating-congestion-with-support-from-our-storied-past",,"If nothing else, I think there is a gracefully-degraded way to turn this into a feasible Challenge idea.

My friends and I have often joked about hopping on the freight trains that are running at slower speeds along the riverside communities in order to go out drinking. If there is any dormant rail in those areas where we could drop a low-cost light rail service (or if, by some miracle, the freight operators could be convinced to hitch some passenger cars along for a short ride), even if it's only taking commuters and drunk guys like me from one neighborhood to the next, the culture boost it could provide might be just as valuable as the transit boost.

Half-baked as my above suggestions may be, the key is in that kind of low-cost implementation. I think it's okay if we start out with a service that only goes from Homestead to Southside. I think it's okay if the service only runs twice a day. I think it's okay if the passenger car is no-frills and a little noisy -- in fact, I'd say we should intentionally embrace Pittsburgh's history and make such a service as close to a freight experience as possible for the sake of tourism and city pride. All that is forgivable and makes for a useful experiment in adoption as long as it costs next to nothing. It would be great to hear some railroad logistics experts chime in to help us knock down costs as far as possible, and then see what we can build from there -- as opposed to the usual rail proposals that plan for optimal service and then whittle the dream down as funding becomes a problem.","mitch","Mitch","Turck","mitch@modernthings.net","USER","2018-06-07 21:53:41","2018-06-07 21:55:27","https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/pittsburgh/explore/eliminating-congestion-with-support-from-our-storied-past/comments#!c-3def184ad8f4755ff269862ea77393dd"

Thanks for the feedback. I kind of knew before posting that would be the case based on the parameters - my hope was though however that the idea would gain visibility with the correct levels of leadership in the city to potentially garner a feasibility study, and research docket to outline and map a potential implementation of a such said idea in phases. 

That being said, and understanding the guidelines of paper to the street. Would the, &quot;City of Tomorrow&quot; group be interested in entertaining professionally conducted research &quot;paper&quot;, and feasibility study that can be presented to industry and government partners &quot;Street&quot;. I do know that's outside probably the general expectations of this endeavor which is probably more intended to showcase something physical that is developed an then showcased. But, with my professional and academic background I'm confident I can put together a legitimate feasibility and research study of the concept - which to me is cheaper for the city than hiring multiple consultants on best way to alleviate congestion. 

I am very passionate about this idea getting out there and developed, it's a great opportunity for the city - an showcases the best of the city of Pittsburgh in solving difficult infrastructure problems in a cogent, and economical manner.

Please let me know if the industry sponsors, city, and your group are up to entertaining the idea of a pure feasibility, and research study on the concept - as I will put in the sweat equity if I can get that material presented in front of the right parties. The proposal would be completely done with phase planning, cost analysis, as well as funding opportunities for the Capex required, etc..

Light Rail is just engineering speak for passenger rail. Essentially  - the, “T” is currently a hybrid of subway and surface track - the concept of converting heavy gauge industrial lines to light rail means extension of the T by extending surface lines using the old industrial tracks not in use. The Metro in D.C. is a great example of that above ground or surface light rail(Light Metro),  and underground light rail(Tube/Subway) in D.C. they run the Surface Rail which is considered light rail out to the burbs, goes underground in inner-city which could be considered a subway.

It’s a much lower cost option then tunneling, and tracking which is why most cities have a hybrid.

"eliminating-congestion-with-support-from-our-storied-past","This is an excellent idea, and I believe it would benefit the city and metropolitan area immensely. 

Pittsburgh's unique geography makes it difficult to expand the highway infrastructure in response to increases in population and traffic demands, leading to heavier congestion, longer commutes, and more wear and tear on the existing roadways. Cities with flatter and more open topography, such as Houston, Dallas, and Phoenix, are able to simply build wider highways and new alternative routes. Pittsburgh needs a different solution, since there simply isn't physical space to expand or construct in such a manner.

All these hundreds of miles of unused track are still viable with some rehab and minor repair, and would have a far more profound impact on the area's economy and environmental outlook than alternative uses, such as the &quot;Rails to Trails&quot; program. While that was a step in the right direction, it came at a significant cost to the municipalities involved, and offered no tangible economic benefit, only aesthetic improvement.

Converting the dormant railways to an integrated light rail and dovetailing with the existing T system would create a strong and sustainable transportation network and put Pittsburgh on par with many larger cities, such as Chicago and San Diego, where the light rail is a necessity and solution for many daily commuters.

Having the easements and physical tracks already in place makes this proposal a simple matter of consolidation and rehabilitation, with a far lower capital outlay than would be required if starting from zero. Stations wouldn't need to be elaborate, simple concrete and metal platforms and entry systems would suffice.

In terms of value to the taxpayer, rail commuting would significantly reduce the cost of the daily commute by eliminating the need to park in the city, saving vehicle fuel and maintenance expenses, and allowing a more predictable commuting timeline, which would translate to more time at home with the family. The additional benefit from fewer cars on the roads and highways would be reduced municipal and state maintenance costs, freeing up precious budget resources for other essential services.

I'm 100% in favor of this idea, and would love to see it become reality!",,"clayton.a.martin","Clayton","Martin","clayton.a.martin@gmail.com","USER","2018-06-07 19:06:29",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/pittsburgh/explore/eliminating-congestion-with-support-from-our-storied-past/comments#!c-6974ce5ac660610b44d9b9fed0ff9548"

Hope you are enjoying your weekend!

Given our previous conversations I was under the impression that presenting this idea in terms of a formal research, and business plan given it's scope was outside the scale of research - or hypothesis expected for this particular challenge. I am definitely passionate about this idea, and would be willing to build a formal business plan - to continue momentum with this idea with the hope that some private investors, government, etc. Could take this idea an seek to implement to alleviate congestion patterns in the city.

One idea I did have that was smaller in scope recently over intellectual discussion with friends, was an app that could allow local farmers to provide fresh produce to city residents downtown in a manner similar to ride sharing where 3rd Party Drivers could pickup orders of enrolled local farms, and deliver them to their customers who ordered the produce through the app. I am not sure how familiar you are with Pittsburgh's geography, but outside the urban center it is fairly rural with a myriad of local farms - felt this might be a way to help local growers, and city consumers with getting access to fresh locally grown produce despite the lack of a central grocery store in the city.

Let me know your thoughts - if I should continue to pursue providing research on the rail conversion research, and proposal - or shift gears to this smaller scale idea.

I have climbed up and down the steps at the Duquesne end of the 10th Street Bridge several times, as the only direct way to walk from Duquesne to SouthSide.

"cranberry-so-called-reverse-commute",,"Hi Again, sorry if I am over-posting, but I think this is a really big issue.  

RIDC developed the Thorn Hill area to help boost Pittsburgh in a number of ways (from my understanding-correct me if I am wrong).  They call it an &quot;industrial park&quot; but my company isn't industrial and this is not out of the norm--there are many corporate entities in this mix.  

My company happens to be an information, publishing, technology, and events entity. We are very valuable to the Pittsburgh area, yet inaccessible to most of the East Side by the current transportation structure. We are a just a small part of why the Cranberry/Mars area is booming, but a lot of us prefer city living, especially because Pittsburgh is so awesome.  However many of my colleagues have moved into Cranberry or Northward.  

I just hired a Pitt master's level grad who lives in Oakland and had to be honest with her about the commute issues.  Luckily, she still accepted the position.  I hope this helps in your research.","rbnutter","Rachel","Sweeney","rbnutter@gmail.com","USER","2018-06-09 23:43:55","2018-06-09 23:58:39","https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/pittsburgh/explore/cranberry-so-called-reverse-commute/comments#!c-f2217062e9a397a1dca429e7d70bc6ca"

"maintaining-pittsburgh-s-bike-lanes-using-open-source-technology-and-ground-truthed-data","Thanks Varun. I guess my immediate question here is why we would limit the detection of road deterioration to bike lanes when Pittsburgh is notorious for its poor road quality in general. That is to say:
1) there are more dangerous and costly road damage issues to fix involving cars
2) the city already has a method for detecting road damage (albeit self-reported, so the ground truth is assumedly a DOT employee checking the reported issue in person.) http://pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/street-maintenance/potholes.html

It would appear your team has created a model and method that can be scaled to the entire roadway -- is that correct? I'd imagine that would make it a much more viable project to undertake, leaving the question of how this approach results in more efficient road repairs than the current self-reported method. I don't know what predictive data the DOT has on road deterioration, but if they're lacking for such insights, your tool could be useful.",,"mitch","Mitch","Turck","mitch@modernthings.net","USER","2018-06-12 05:12:20","2018-06-12 05:14:55","https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/pittsburgh/explore/maintaining-pittsburgh-s-bike-lanes-using-open-source-technology-and-ground-truthed-data/comments#!c-bd4c9ab730f5513206b999ec0d90d1fb"
"maintaining-pittsburgh-s-bike-lanes-using-open-source-technology-and-ground-truthed-data",,"Hey <Umitch><Mitch Turck>&nbsp;! Nice to see you here.

YES! SQUID can most definitely be used on regular streets and we've worked with the city of Syracuse, NY and NYC to demonstrate the effectiveness of that approach. http://wrvo.org/post/squid-give-syracuse-better-feel-needed-road-repairs

We were able to collect 400-500 miles worth of Ground Truthed data with a single vehicle over 10 days. (That's 75% of Syracuse's entire street grid)

For Pittsburgh, we made a conscious decision to focus on bike lanes because: 

1. It moves the needle farther for a specific user group (bike commuters).
2. Better suited to win hearts and minds of traditional public works managers who can be skeptical of this approach.
3. Bike lanes are a throwback to SQUID's origins when Patrick and I rode 100 miles in NYC collecting bumpiness data in the fall of 2014. More about the SQUID story here: https://www.hackster.io/argo/squid-street-quality-identification-device-a43367
4. More suited to a community engagement angle where you can &quot;adopt your bike lane&quot; by using Open Street Cam to survey the bike lane outside your house.

re: efficient road repairs: The conventional response paradigm uses on a combination of PCI  (Pavement Condition Index) scores,  user complaints, and perhaps other unknown criteria. The PCI standard was developed in the 1970s and relies on eyeballing road conditions and assigning an overall score. This is far too subjective and prone to error. Furthermore, pothole fixing crews are routed in a whack-a-mole manner which is not necessarily the most efficient allocation of maintenance resources.

I'd rather use the term anticipatory vs the rather loaded &quot;predictive maintenance&quot;. This is something we are eager to prove out.  The marginal cost of collecting high quality data frequently about all streets in a city has reduced exponentially and this can get cities out of a &quot;whack-a-mole&quot; response paradigm and into a more proactive one which we believe will lead to more efficient (and data driven) allocation of maintenance crews.","varun","Varun","Adibhatla","varun@argolabs.org","USER","2018-06-12 15:41:33",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/pittsburgh/explore/maintaining-pittsburgh-s-bike-lanes-using-open-source-technology-and-ground-truthed-data/comments#!c-a4a042cf4fd6bfb47701cbc8a1653ada"

Mitch who is paying for the shuttle? Passengers? The City?

And I'm offering the idea of tourist info booth specially tailored to tourists with mobility issues as you have suggested an accessible shuttle.

"turn-roberto-clemente-bridge-into-a-permanent-shuttle-route",,"Thanks Katie. Regarding who foots the shuttle bill, I'm most concerned about minimizing friction (e.g. not forcing riders to have the fee on-hand, or sign up for a rider card, etc.), as a free walk-on shuttle would provide the greatest chance for reaching critical mass. In that respect I'd offer a few options:

1. Taxpayers: this shuttle would serve most of the city's major event attractions and could alleviate some traffic in the city's largest workzones. It also improves access for non-driving residents who would be taking buses or the T. In those respects, every city resident stands to benefit, and so taxing residents makes sense.

2. Local businesses: given the implied boost in foot traffic and cultural cache this shuttle would create (specifically for businesses that don't generate parking revenue, like the theaters and restaurants and galleries and casino), it seems reasonable to get the funding through a tax on certain businesses within the 15-minute walk zone. Assuming the worst (the businesses respond by raising prices to the consumer), that still gets you back to a reasonable result where the taxpayers are covering the cost, though in this case it's only the taxpayers who patronize the businesses served by the shuttle. I'd argue that's a more accurate tax than spreading it out across all city residents, so this may be the optimal route.

While there may be some eye rolls over the notion of local businesses funding mass transit, I'll point out that the darling of the transit world (Hong Kong's subway -- arguably the only profitable subway in the world) operates in a similar fashion. Hong Kong profits where the likes of NYC falters because HK taxes the businesses its subway service reaches. It brings the customers to your door. If you want to charge customers more to recoup that tax, that's your decision.","mitch","Mitch","Turck","mitch@modernthings.net","USER","2018-06-12 16:06:05","2018-06-12 16:07:00","https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/pittsburgh/explore/turn-roberto-clemente-bridge-into-a-permanent-shuttle-route/comments#!c-f7e6c85504ce6e82442c770f7c8606f0"

"waiting-for-transit-should-be-welcoming-and-enjoyable","On a similar note, simply reducing the friction of first-time use is a huge obligation that public transit generally ignores and suffers because of.

There are many, many trips that could be taken via transit -- even by people who have already driven to a destination away from home -- which are squandered because of the natural aversion to change and/or disinterest in thinking that humans exhibit.

Consideration for converting first-time riders is something any private player would do (Uber, Bird, etc.), and transit needs to invest in the same; I'm certain there are many designers and UX people out there who are pro-transit, and those folks should be brought to the table to find affordable solutions to this end.

"how-about-the-exurbs","Having circumnavigated the US twice and visited 46 of the 50 most-populated cities, I am inclined to disagree with your portrait of America's cities on the whole, and I think leaning on America's 1st (by far) and 3rd-most used transit systems as examples are proof of the gap here. Pittsburgh is not NYC or DC, and much of the infrastructure that allowed your friend to catch a train to Grant St. was built back when PGH believed it was indeed going to be like those cities and America thought only about building rather than sustaining... which are why the services no longer exist.

This is an argument made in hundreds of cities across the country time and time again, and my suggestion is that if you want to forward the idea, you do the math on population density &amp; growth, as well as identify potential growth along a proposed line (e.g. roughly following Rt. 885 from McKeesport to Downtown).

Geographic distinctions aside, I would offer that Allegheny County's closest comparison is Jacksonville, FL in size and density. I am a resident of that city and I've yet to meet anyone who uses public transit there.

Edit: I'd also say that, if nothing else, funding for fixed path transit like streetcars and trains can be best supported by evidence of healthy bus usage -- to that end, you may want to make sure the BRT project is moving in the direction you want it to re: the populations it will service and the populations it may take service away from:

That said, I'm not incredibly familiar with PGH's bus services as a) I haven't lived there in 5 years and b) I never took the bus when I did live there -- but as far as whether or not it's feasible, I'd say the first step here is the same as any argument for increased transit service: show that there is demand, and show how the costs will be covered.

I think having to make those arguments is usually where people end up detuning their transit proposals down to something more feasible, like extended service. It's certainly more feasible to propose a lower-cost, zero-construction initiative and avoid broader debates about the effects of sprawl and tax obligations, which would undoubtedly be a topic of controversy if one proposed a train line from McKeesport to Downtown.","mitch","Mitch","Turck","mitch@modernthings.net","USER","2018-06-20 17:30:14","2018-06-20 17:30:25","https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/pittsburgh/explore/how-about-the-exurbs/comments#!c-298f95e1bf9136124592c8d4825a06fc"
"how-about-the-exurbs","I have to agree with Sean......  Having lived here most of my life (with an 8 month stay in Chicago) the Port Authority’s vision is EXTREMELY limited.  I have worked both in downtown PGH and in the suburbs (Cranberry &amp; Robinson).  The T should have been piped out to the North Hills (eventually hitting Wexford &amp; Cranberry) along with the Airport (Also serving Robinson and communities on the other side of the tunnel) YEARS AGO.  Instead they spent money to build a tunnel under the river to the North Side.  Ok it gives more parking options for Downtown PGH, but that is not the center of PGH commerce anymore.  I am not a huge fan of Downtown PGH being the center of public transportation and think the money to get the T over to the other side of the river could have been much better spent. 

I would GLADLY take the T to work in Cranberry to save on gas and to save my nerves from the “left lane drivers” who either refuse to move or take sadistic joy in making ppl pass them on the right side of the road.

We have some of the higher public transit fares in the country coupled with the least amount of options/choices for public transit.

"winter-in-pittsburgh",,"Greenfield.  Free parking for five buses was available at Greenfield, Hazelwood Avenue and Irvine Street.  The free parking was on Irvine but a bike lane eliminated the parking.

In the winter I cannot drive due to the steep hill I live on and black ice on the road.  I cannot get a bus due to schedules and cannot walk down the hill in black ice.

In reality bikes can only be used in Pittsburgh about four months of the year.  Snow and ice in the winter, heavy rains in April and June.

Please note that I love the bike trails and walk them all the time.   Only licensed vehicles should be on the street.  When I make a right hand turn with a green light I have to watch that a bike has not squeezed next to my car in a blind spot.  Most bikers do not abide by traffic regulations.

The City of Pittsburgh needs to concentrate on water, replacing old pipes, reconstruction of roads that have been patched for years, police protection, particularly after the shut down of our parkway last night, etc.

"winter-in-pittsburgh",,"Ally,
The majority of Pittsburgh roads are steep and narrow.  I have to pull over on my street when cars are coming the opposite way and going around bends in the road you are often limited to visibility less than one half a car length.  This is a TYPICAL road in Pittsburgh for streets that are not primary roads.  This makes it near impossible to be able to see bikes.  Bikers going up Greenfield Avenue tie up traffic because they are going less than 5 miles an hour.  Passing them is dangerous because of incoming traffic around sharp blind turns 

The only section of Pittsburgh with good public transit is the South Hills that has  T line.  If you live in the suburbs of Pittsburgh which are often a 20 to 30 minutes drive without traffic the buses run only early in the morning and during rush hour.  Those people are forced to find jobs that meet the bus schedule or drive and in rush hour it can take sixty to ninety minutes for a thirty minute trip.

Mass transit and roads need to take priority over bikes.","lyons08","Mary","Lyons","lyons08@yahoo.com","USER","2018-06-22 20:54:33",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/pittsburgh/explore/winter-in-pittsburgh/comments#!c-766ebcd59621e305170616ba3d3dac32"

"winter-in-pittsburgh",,"Hi Aly, 

The scoots they are mentioning kind of looking like a ravor scoot that you stand on. The most common one is Bird. With Bird and it competitors, you download an app and then you can see where all the scooters in the city are. You can find the closest scooter to you, and then unlock it through the app. When you are down you lock it with the app, and can leave it anywhere. People in SF are leaving them in the middle of the side walk. SF is working on rules about how and where you can leave the scooters. 

What I am talking about is turning bicycles into Hybrids. There are bikes, and kits that people can buy so that they get an electric boost when they peddle. Most of these bikes cost at leak $1500, but they give you the ability to travel faster, further, and up hills without sweating. The one that I posted below you can test out at Love Bikes in Lawrenceville. I took it down Butler and then up the hill to the hospital, made it up the hill without sweating, without standing, and going about 13mph.

"accessibility-and-inclusion",,"Hi Aly - happy to share more details; thanks for reaching out!

I think that the missing curb cut issue is definitely getting better. There are still a few downtown (though I don't remember the exact locations). When I have to backtrack after these, it's not too far - usually I have to go back to the beginning of the block I just came from, and cross at the beginning rather than the end. I do find that often, when there's a sidewalk closure due to construction, there is no temporary ramp placed near the closure, so then I have to backtrack again. I do know that each year, when the pedestrian pathway is created during the Marathon (to take viewers from the race course to the finish line area at the Point) there is one part of it that takes you down a flight of stairs, with no signage for people with disabilities.

Sometimes, what can be more problematic than missing curb cuts is the sidewalk conditions, especially in Squirrel Hill and Shadyside. The sidewalks can have cracks the size of potholes, or sometimes, due to tree trunks growing, one section can be pushed up so high that it essentially creates a step. When this happens, I have to go onto the road. And in the winter, many sidewalks in these neighborhoods (especially in the more residential areas) are not cleared, again making the sidewalks impossible for me to navigate.

I'm not a frequent bus rider, but the issue of bus drivers not pulling up to the proper spot is something that I've paid close attention to as a pedestrian, and I would say that bus drivers do not stop at the designated spot at least 50% of the time. I realize that it's possible they would stop at the correct spot if I were in the bus, but that shouldn't need to happen. When they fail to stop at the correct spot, they also create issues for people with strollers, etc., and also can create traffic flow problems as they block intersections. When I did ride the bus, I found that many drivers were not comfortable with using the tie-down system to keep my wheelchair from sliding while the bus moved. Some drivers were great, but many did not know how to use them.

Finally, one thing I have noticed all over the city is that the buttons to get the pedestrian walk/don't walk signals to change are often so high on the pole that they are out of my reach. For some intersections, the pedestrian signal doesn't change with the light itself - it relies on the button being pressed for it to change. This happens to me frequently at the corner of the Carnegie Library and Schenley Plaza in Oakland - I have to risk going out into traffic just to cross the street.","heather.tomko","Heather","Tomko","heather.tomko@gmail.com","USER","2018-06-29 00:39:13","2018-06-29 00:40:32","https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/pittsburgh/explore/accessibility-and-inclusion/comments#!c-e995f98d56967d946471af29d7bf99f1"

I was not on the T but I was driving on 88, yes during the 6/20 flash flooding. The particular cross-section was Library &amp; Kings School Rd. It was very deep and gushing. I could see the &quot;river&quot; on the T's tracks. This is actually the first time I've dealt with this, but I know that Library Rd. has had this happen numerous times.
I tried to think about an alternate way to get home (that intersection had a gushing puddle about maybe 1-2 feet deep), but I didn't want to chance going another way and seeing an even worse situation.

"autonomous-vehicles-need-to-see-cyclists-and-pedestrians","Hi Anna, welcome and thanks for the post! It seems you are addressing two issues here - pedestrian safety in general and more specifically with the addition of autonomous vehicles. I do recall the self-driving ubers having those large spinning sensors on top of them, which was nice for identification purposes. I am unsure if other AVs are set up in a similar fashion. So where would you start with addressing these concerns? Would you intervene with the vehicle safety and set up, or would you work on improving bike lane access?

A solution to this is having a predictable place for bikes and pedestrians to be. I.e. sidewalks and bike lanes. Since AVs operate with predictability and set boundaries having these spaces would help AVs drive and give peds and cyclists the space and place to be to feel safe. But to help with the development of AVs there needs to be a way to provide feedback and ensure safety now. So the issue goes hand in hand.

"boundary-st-bike-lift","Hi Craig, 

I think we need multiple bike lifts to get people from one neighborhood to the next. We have a lot of areas that are divided by hills and make it difficult for people to want to ride. Another option would be a tax credit for people looking to purchase an electric assist bicycle. I took a few of them out for a ride last year and it is a game changer when going up a hill.

I'm very excited to see you bring up what is an incredibly important and at times overlooked issue...and very happy to see your discussion with Heather. I hope others join in and voice their opinions and experiences. 
The applications of autonomous vehicles for improving quality and ease of transit for people with disabilities is quite interesting...autonomous cars have been brought up here several times, but not yet with regard to improving accessibility for folks with physical disabilities. I'm wondering about what the benefits/challenges of utilizing wheelchair accessible autonomous vehicles would be, as opposed to just making regular ubers/taxis/shuttles wheelchair accessible. Any thoughts?",,"aly2","Aly","Stone","aly@100open.com","ADMIN","2018-07-01 05:12:59",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/pittsburgh/explore/disabilities-achieva-is-the-largest-provider-of-lifetime-supports-to-people-with-disabilities-in-the-region/comments#!c-ab88b15733f543179858600245108dd8"
"disabilities-achieva-is-the-largest-provider-of-lifetime-supports-to-people-with-disabilities-in-the-region",,"I think the benefit of making autonomous vehicles accessible (over regular Ubers) is that the vehicles are standardized. They don’t require a person/driver to own an accessible van, and be willing to drive it around for Uber, and be in an area where someone with disability wants to travel. I also think that autonomous vehicles are something that we’ve moving towards, in general, as a society. So if we don’t make plans for them to be accessible NOW, from the outset, we’re going to run into the same issue that exists with regular Ubers - no (or incredibly limited) use for people with disabilities. Retrofitting is always so much more difficult, as we’ve seen countless times. 

The challenge, I think, is making vehicles that are rideable for people with and without disabilities, to maximize efficiency of the supply. Another challenge lies in the mechanism of the tie- downs to secure  wheelchairs. Can they be automized, too? And accessible autonomous vehicles need more than just a ramp and tie-downs - the acceleration/deceleration needs to be gradual, etc.","heather.tomko","Heather","Tomko","heather.tomko@gmail.com","USER","2018-07-02 11:56:27",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/pittsburgh/explore/disabilities-achieva-is-the-largest-provider-of-lifetime-supports-to-people-with-disabilities-in-the-region/comments#!c-a67f096809415ca1c9f112d96d27689b"
"disabilities-achieva-is-the-largest-provider-of-lifetime-supports-to-people-with-disabilities-in-the-region",,"Aly, thanks.  It certainly is an important issue.  

When you use a regular uber/taxi/shuttle that is wheelchair accessible does the person who is the drive have any experience being around someone with a disability?  What is their comfort level? Can they communicate with the passenger who might have an intellectual disability or communication issue? If it is someone who owns a wheelchair accessible vehicle, they more than likely have experience being around someone in a wheelchair but is that someone who utilizes a manual wheelchair versus a powered wheelchair? Does that someone have other disabilities?  Autonomous vehicles could alleviate these issues.

I agree with Heather's reply regarding tie downs for wheelchairs and the acceleration/deceleration issue.   I think there also needs to be a consideration for people with disabilities who have sensory issues related to their disability. The sounds and textures inside the vehicle can be important.

"staggered-work-hours",,"Hi Aly.
I walked to work for 9 years but since my recent move, I must now rely on public transit.&nbsp; The trolleys and buses are so packed that not everyone can get on.&nbsp; I see this as becoming more of a problem during city growth.
School districts could set up (2) five hour shifts that run year-round with two-week breaks between semesters.  For example, shifts could be 7 to 12 and 2 to 7, allowing a two hour window to get students in and out of school during midday.  Parents could request the shift preference with the final decision resting on the school board.
Employers could jump on board and offer shifts that correspond with parental obligations.  It would make sense for state or national government to offer incentives to employers that contribute to after school programs at or near their work locations.  It would be an investment in our nation’s youth and in the quality of life of the employees.&nbsp; 
Of course, this is changing habits and will require strong intentions set by parents and employers.&nbsp; The alternative is to add more trolley tracks which would be helpful and expensive.&nbsp; Staggering work hours uses existing resources more productively.
Thanks for asking!

"pittsburgh-deserves-sidewalks",,"Hi Aly, thanks for your comments/feedback as well! And way to get all the acronyms correctly -- that's no easy trick! I ran out of characters and wasn't able to spell them out, so apologies to others that may have struggled discerning who I was referring to. 

In terms of addressing your questions about the scope of this project idea, a full, citywide conditions assessment needs to be completed in order to determine the neighborhoods and corridors with the highest priority of needs. Plus, right now, that's part of the problem -- we don't have a dataset to reference or point to for informing our decisions around where to invest Capital Budget $$ strategically. Part of the goal of conducting this citywide assessment would also be to show residents, local officials, business owners, and others that whether you're in more affluent neighborhoods or a low-moderate income (LMI) neighborhood, the common theme is that there aren't quality, connected sidewalk networks that allow all modes/users to travel independently. But until I can point on a map and show you with hard evidence, I don't think people will believe that this assertion is true. 

After completing the citywide conditions assessment, the top priorities should be 1) expanding the sidewalk to fill significant gaps 2) working to create a dedicated fund  for private property owners, particularly for LMI and elderly households, to help subsidize the cost of maintenance/repairs of existing sidewalks and 3) the City working to amend the existing legislation/policy around private property owners bearing the burden of these public realm maintenance/repair expectations.","kschlesinger","Kathryn","Schlesinger","kschlesinger@pcrg.org","USER","2018-07-02 19:27:14",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/pittsburgh/explore/pittsburgh-deserves-sidewalks/comments#!c-67d16d00201083a2b118dd5128dd6f59"

"pittsburgh-deserves-sidewalks","Hi <Ukschlesinger><Kathryn Schlesinger>&nbsp;--

Generally, I think this is an excellent presentation of an undervalued mobility resource. As an autonomous vehicle advocate, however, I do feel compelled to make a few arguments regarding the future of walkable space, as my contention is that we could get the outcome you're looking for without the need for specific action or investment:

A. Just to get this out of the way: while no one can say with certainty when self-driving vehicles will begin commercial roll-out, there are many (myself included) who see 2025 as a very reasonable timeline for significant penetration of shuttles, taxis, etc. in areas where human-driven cars would be excluded. If you'll humor that timeline, the obvious follow-up question is: how long will it take to construct prominent sidewalk installs/upgrades, and how long would those sidewalks need to be operational to deliver ROI if the advent of driverless traffic made them unnecessary?

B. I ask because there are several inherent design components of autonomous vehicles (AVs) which imply (again, humor me and everyone else who subscribes to these assumptions) that walkable space will be created organically, without the need for major construction:
- AVs cut down on the total number of vehicles in operation, due to ridesharing options and a usage-based model rather than ownership-based. Fewer vehicles and fewer parking spaces = more space for people.
- AVs minimize the need for convenience-based parking, which means the ~50% of a street's pavement currently relegated to parked cars could become  the sidewalks while the cars park themselves in a garage or lot somewhere.
- Having fewer cars, and having many of them off the streets when parked, is how you get your space... but how you ensure the space feels safe is by way of the AVs' driving behaviors, which not only aim to be safer and more considerate of pedestrians by design, but also drive slower, more predictably, and (one assumes) with a standardized communication language between vehicle and pedestrian. In short, moving vehicles in the future will not be feared by pedestrians.
- While AVs certainly don't need to be electric-powered, there are few outside of traditional carmakers who believe they'll be anything but. To that end, the picture we've painted now is not only a significant increase in walking space and a significant decrease in fear/danger of traffic, but also a significant (almost total) decrease in the health risks and unappealing experience of being  near gas-powered vehicles. This on-road ped space could be designed to house seating, gardens, playgrounds... all manner of amenities that would be frowned upon with conventional traffic's pollutants.

Long story short: if you believe the sidewalk project is a 2-3 year investment, and you believe the proliferation of self-driving tech is 2-3 decades away, then your proposal seems solid. If instead, you believe the sidewalk project is a 5-year effort, and you believe self-driving tech will have a significant presence by 2025, then I would contend there is a lot more usable pedestrian space coming just around the corner.",,"mitch","Mitch","Turck","mitch@modernthings.net","USER","2018-07-14 04:54:46",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/pittsburgh/explore/pittsburgh-deserves-sidewalks/comments#!c-3c947bc2f7ff007b86a9428b74654de5"

"extend-the-t-to-the-airport","I have to agree that the 28x is an embarrassment.  When I fly into Boston, the easiest way to get into town is the FREE silver line.  Why rent a car when the silver line is so easy and fast?  Then once I'm in town, I'm already familiar with transit.  What a smart way to welcome me.
In Pittsburgh, we get a bus that runs every 30 minutes, doesn't like to take cash, has NO LUGGAGE RACKS and then wanders about on its way into town.  I ride the bus all the time and I REALLY dislike the 28X.  I regularly cough up the $40 each way to avoid the hassle, and I'm a cheapskate.  
If you're a visitor, you have to learn a new system, deal with the long headway, struggle with your luggage, try to navigate transfers... NOT a great welcome to our wonderful city.

"extend-the-t-to-the-airport","This is a reply to Aly Stone's comment below about why I dislike the 28X. 

Yes, Ive taken the 28X to the airport. Many, many times. In both directions. 

Jeff's Ericson's comment below sums up my objections succinctly. Very little to add there. Like Jeff, I'm a regular bus rider in the City (I haven't owned a car in 15 years) so it's not like my objections are caused by inexperience with public transit. It's just a bad way to get to/from the airport. Not only does it run only every 30 minutes, you're subjected to the vagaries of traffic -- rush hour, construction, accidents, etc.

And like Jeff, I've used the Silver Line in Boston. And the MAX in Portland. And Link Light Rail in Seattle.  The AirTrain at JFK. The Canada Line in Vancouver BC. Caltrain all the way from San Francisco to the San Jose airport...well, sort of. There's a little shuttle at the end, but I think you know where I'm going with this.

If Pittsburgh wants to continue to talk about itself as some sort of city of the future, as livable in ways few other cities are, as a city worthy of international attention (and international business), it needs to put its money where its mouth is. Rail to the airport is basic. It's a basic first step. It needed to be addressed years ago.",,"tdc2","Terrence","Chiusano","tdc2@andrew.cmu.edu","USER","2018-07-20 14:26:48",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/pittsburgh/explore/extend-the-t-to-the-airport/comments#!c-b8b4b727d6f5d1b61fff7be687f7970f"

My name is Wilda, one of the facilitators here. Thanks so much for being one of our community memebers here on the platform. We’re so glad to have you! 

It sounds like you’re adversed to having cars and bikes share the road. Let me ask... 

1. How much bike lane, measured in miles, do you believe Pittsburgh has? 

2. Bikes are considered vehicles and this have a set of rules they must  follow for sharing the road with cars. Do you find that they are not abiding by them and thus leading to congestion?? Do the bikes being on the road cause accidents? 

3. Which months  do you propose the roads be off limits to bikes and why during that particular time of year?",,"wilda3","Wilda","Previl","wilda@100open.com","ADMIN","2018-07-05 18:32:51",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/pittsburgh/explore/roads-are-for-cars/comments#!c-53adaf494dc89ef7196d73636eb2451b"

"buses-are-great-but-please-use-just-your-lane","I don't understand the issue...are you talking about pulling into a parking lane? Or just a curbside travel lane? Fifth and Penn don't have parking for long stretches so buses just pick up from the curbside travel lane. Centre is the only street where there's parking for most of it, but this should be a bus-priority street; the bus lines that run down it have some 20,000 riders a day; only about 10,000 cars use the street.

Buses are gonna be too wide to fit fully into the parking lane anyway; parking lanes are generally 7' and buses are 8.5' wide. And in many places, to fully pull over (pull-out stop) would require removing 100+ feet of parking. 

In any case, I support in-lane stops to give buses priority.

1. As someone who is constantly traveling back and forth, east and west of Pittsburgh, I'll agree about the loop. Currently, I just know to never try to leave the city at rush hour. 
2. Tell us more about which roads you're specifically referring to and at what times the problems are the most pronounced. I do notice this on 376 going West before the Fort Pitt tunnel constantly and it is pretty stressful. 
3. Oh there we go, Fort Pitt tunnel. Any other areas where you notice this issue? How much does it tend to delay you?

"i-avoid-going-to-or-through-downtown-pittsburgh-at-all-costs",,"1.  Finishing the loop is a no-brainer - I mean, even Wheeling, WV built a loop years ago to avoid traffic at their tunnel and downtown area.  I traveled to (and eventually lived in) the Houston TX area back in 70's and 80's.  They built the 610 loop before Houston started expanding.  During the boom, they started working on the Beltway 8 loop.  Now they're building a third loop.  Amazing that some cities have the forethought to stay ahead of expansion, rather than always trying to catch up.

2. I live in Moon so in traveling to the Point in Pittsburgh, there are no less than 5 such areas on the Parkway West (376): a) intersection of Business 376 (Montour Run exit); b) intersection of The Point shopping area (Route 22/30 W exit); c) intersection of 22/30 on ramp (Settler's Ridge exit); d) Banksville Road (Route 19/51 exits); e) and ON the bridge, Rt 51 on ramp (the North Shore and Fort Duquesne Blvd exits).  I don't know how many accidents have occurred in these intersections, but I personally have seen and been involved in dozens of close calls.  And this is all just in one direction on one major artery!

3. The Fort Duquesne Bridge is set up the same way, and the biggest problem here is you can't read the signs until you you're  right up on them.  It you're going from say East Allegheny to the Airport, you enter the Duquesne Bridge from the left and you have to get all the way over to the right to get to the Fort Pitt bridge, then you have to merge twice more to get into a lane than gets into the tunnel.   The delays and the stress are excruciating.  Luckily, if you find a friendly driver (much fewer these days), you can maneuver into the correct lane.  Otherwise, it's major detour time!  
Trying to go from Rt. 65 to Rt. 28 is another fiasco.  Why does it route you down into stadium traffic to make that connection?  There should be a dedicated lane connecting those two highways.  Areas like this occur all over town.  That's why I avoid them.  I either travel HOURS ahead of time to avoid the traffic (and to get parking, which is another issue!) or I just don't go at all.  We used to have memberships at the zoo, Phipps, the Benedum; we used to go see ball games - but now we look North and West for activities.  We had our grandkids here for a week in late June and didn't go toward Pittsburgh even once.  They keep announcing plans to build up the North Shore, but they don't do anything to make it easier to get there.  
Another thing that gets me is that there is no link to the airport from Moon, without first transferring through Robinson !?!?!?   Thank goodness for Uber!  Or here's another no-brainer - from Pittsburgh to the Airport - where's the subway?  No, instead they extend it to the North Shore, which is easily walkable.

Either adds like 20 miles to the overall trip. Why spend billions of dollars for a new highway that will save only 20 miles travel? Even with the south beltway, it would probably only save you 10 miles.

"i-avoid-going-to-or-through-downtown-pittsburgh-at-all-costs","It's not the miles Craig . . . it's the time.  Have you ever tried getting to 79 from the airport area in the afternoon, especially Friday afternoon?  It is often backed from the 79 entrance all the way back to the 376 split.  I'd rather travel an extra 10 or 20 miles, than sit in bumper-to-bumper traffic for 45 - 60 minutes.  I think a loop would also open up business in other areas around the city.   I don't remember the last time i went to the convention center in Monroeville - it too much of a hassle to get there through the tunnels and bridges in town.  With the loop, I'd consider it.  Same for areas north of the city.  

The only issue though, is with how the loop is constructed.  So far, we've seen this area's short-sightedness by only making the 1st two pieces of the loop a 4 lane highway.  I would think ANY newly constructed highways should be a minimum of 6 lanes.  Look what they're having to do with the turnpike now.  
Don't get me wrong, i love the piece of 576 that has been completed, especially with the removal of the exit tool booths.

There are some folks in PGH working on solutions in this vein... I'll echo <Ualy2><Aly Stone>&nbsp;'s question re: what neighborhoods you're referring to. I would also say that unlike many other transit solutions, this is one that can easily be tested for viability by any community member with a van or SUV. If there is any fundamental point that's worth driving home about the battle for transit funding, it is that one needs to show legitimate demand for the service to make a convincing argument.

"community-van-carpool-signs-at-stops",,"I think we can all agree that giving someone everything they need to pilot a project would lead to piloting said project.

What I'm saying is that because you are battling with many others in the region over a limited pool of funds, you stand to make a much more compelling case than others because your pilot -- unlike high-speed rail or a new airport -- can be reasonably simulated on a lower scale in order to prove that the coordination is possible, that the demand exists, and that the outcomes are positive.

And on the flipside, failing to simulate a pilot given such reasonable hurdles only further brings into question its viability. I point all this out in part because you (or someone) will obviously have to defend such points to the COTC if you want this idea to progress.","mitch","Mitch","Turck","mitch@modernthings.net","USER","2018-07-09 15:36:33",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/pittsburgh/explore/community-van-carpool-signs-at-stops/comments#!c-6449f44a102fde848669bdd9eb6b76fa"
"accurate-reliable-real-time-mobility-information-for-all","Hi Alex, thanks for the post! I think <Uapaperninja><Kymberly Walters>&nbsp;would certainly agree with you here <C308><Something needs to be done about the flash flooding problems. Certain areas require more drainage. The T line in Bethel Park was a river.>&nbsp;I'm glad you've been thinking about how to address this problem. I'd like to encourage you to head over to the Propose Phase of the challenge if you are developing any specific plans that are within the scope of the project. I think others would appreciate seeing your ideas. Also - we have a workshop coming up soon in the city (check the calendar linked on the top) - which may be helpful!

"are-people-with-disabilities-part-of-your-calculus","Hi Shayla, welcome and thanks for such an important post! Good point about the necessity of being especially thoughtful about accessibility considering the unique and extremely hilly topography of Pittsburgh. It would be wonderful if you could chime in with your thoughts in the Propose Phase of the challenge, as we are starting to make headway on ideas there. I hope to see you there.
