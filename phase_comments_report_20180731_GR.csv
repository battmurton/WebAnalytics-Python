Splitting my work between Holland and Grand Rapids, we are very spoiled by the heated sidewalks in downtown Holland come winter. Adopting a similar system would be great, but would also be very expensive.

"how-walkable-is-the-city-in-the-rain-or-snow","Downtown has the skywalk, so that helps significantly in iffy weather for the downtown area. I'd like to see more robust enforcement of the sidewalk clearing ordinance. Right now, it's only enforced when a property is reported. The problem is, few people report to the City, so people can not clear their walks with impunity. If the City had the reputation of being sticklers about sidewalks being cleared, people would do the job, or ask for help if they couldn't. Red Wing, MN inspects for non-clearing of sidewalks and will immediately clear them and charge for the service if it's not done by the property owner. Even if Grand Rapids only did a rotating enforcement (check some random areas, but not necessarily all of them), people would learn quickly. https://www.red-wing.org/thanks-for-shoveling-your-sidewalk.html",,"lmmuresan","Laura","Muresan","lmmuresan@yahoo.com","USER","2018-06-28 15:14:29",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/grand-rapids/explore/how-walkable-is-the-city-in-the-rain-or-snow/comments#!c-19bc916108fc6938f52cb96f7e087941"

"how-walkable-is-the-city-in-the-rain-or-snow","I live in East Hills and work right downtown behind the arena and can say absolutely that the weather slows pedestrian traffic. When the weather is pleasant and dry (that can mean spring-summer-fall), there are regularly people out walking lunch hours to various hot spots, etc. At my home, there's a lot of people still walking year-round. We live in an area that definitely pings the 311 app over absentee landlords plowing sidewalks. We also have single side parking to deal with those months. But I can definitely say in my experience that rain and snow definitely causes people to rethink their mobility option - whether that means their own car or to just stay put. Whereas bigger cities people still have to get done what they need to get done so they keep going outside even if they're disgruntled about it (thinking about my experiences in Chicago).",,"meagen.coburn","Meagen","Coburn","meagen.coburn@gmail.com","USER","2018-07-10 02:00:22",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/grand-rapids/explore/how-walkable-is-the-city-in-the-rain-or-snow/comments#!c-052335232b11864986bb2fa20fa38748"

"getting-around-ne","I regularly commute to work here in GR. 

My daily commute is about 3 total miles between the southeast side and downtown. I know what streets make me feel safest, so my rides are generally pleasant. Still, I do get heckled by drivers randomly. Riding downtown is very nice as there are many traffic lights--sure, this prevents a smooth ride but it also prevents drivers from driving inattentively. 

Cycling near Riverside Park is actually very enjoyable--Monroe Ave has some of the better biking lanes because I believe it's effectively the beginning of a much larger bike trail called the White Pine Trail. I've taken the trail to a brewery north of town in Rockford a couple of times--it's a very pleasant ride. And the trail itself extends much further—almost 100 miles!

But back to biking in the city: While downtown and the area near Riverside Park are nice, other areas in the city can be less than ideal. Yes, we have a good amount of bike lanes and sharrows but the attitude of drivers is not often welcoming. I think some more education and awareness programming would be useful, though I am uncertain how much of an effect previous marketing has made. Converting more drivers to cyclists would certainly be useful but that is a tough sell for many people.

Generally, riding in GR boils down to being aware of your surroundings and cognizant of what drivers may or may not do. I think this applies to all cities though. To ride more defensively, I try to anticipate traffic patterns as I approach and make eye contact with anyone attempting to drive/bike/walk in front of me, just to make sure they acknowledge my path. I think that in time, GR will have a better bike culture but for now, we’ve got what we’ve got. The results of this challenge certainly could help!",,"mrknaack","Matt","Knaack","mrknaack@gmail.com","USER","2018-06-27 17:29:30","2018-06-27 17:29:46","https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/grand-rapids/explore/getting-around-ne/comments#!c-3a066bda8c96b9478bb0512f0a43028c"

"getting-around-ne",,"Yep--that's the one! 

I looked into it a bit more after I made my comments and found this: https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2016/11/bicycle_crashes_decline_follow.html. 

It looks like the number of accidents involving cyclists decreased from 72 to 42 over the previous year: May-Sept 2016 vs. May-Sept 2015. This is great news but I don't think the campaign decreased the perceived divide between drivers and bikers. I still get random people yelling at me, I still have cars passing too close to me or riding right behind me, I still sit at lights that do not sense me and fail to change unless a car comes to a stop at the intersection. Worse yet, I do not know anyone who has chosen to start commuting to work via bike because it can be a scary thing to do for the first time--especially when you haven't been educated on how to safely ride among auto traffic.

I'm grateful for the GR Driving Change campaign as a baseline. But if we really want to change the way people drive, we need more bikers. If we want more bikers, we need stronger biking education. 

There are some programs working toward this already--the GGRBC (https://www.bikegr.org/) is just one of several. I believe Spoke Folks and Boston Square also prioritize education. 

With all of that said, I think I'm eager and impatient and perhaps my energy would be best used by getting involved with such an organization rather than arm-chairing from my computer screen. 

And perhaps the bike-sharing scheme mentioned by Cristina will be a strong force for what I'm talking about. I'll have to look into that more too!","mrknaack","Matt","Knaack","mrknaack@gmail.com","USER","2018-06-28 14:21:21","2018-06-28 14:23:18","https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/grand-rapids/explore/getting-around-ne/comments#!c-4a47d2983c8bd392b120b627e0e1cab4"
"getting-around-ne",,"The attitudes of some drivers stem, in part, from thinking cyclists don't follow the rules (though this could just be an excuse on drivers' parts). Honestly, some of the rules don't make sense for cyclists and are impractical to follow. If we could get the Idaho Stop implemented in Michigan or Grand Rapids, it would bike riding easier, and likely wouldn't affect safety (face it, it's what lots of cyclists already do); it could help change perceptions of cyclists, and could make cycling look like a more convenient option than it might currently appear.","lmmuresan","Laura","Muresan","lmmuresan@yahoo.com","USER","2018-06-28 15:03:37",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/grand-rapids/explore/getting-around-ne/comments#!c-1ecfb463472ec9115b10c292ef8bc986"
"getting-around-ne",,"Thinking about what you said about needing more bikers so that drivers can get used to seeing bikes and use the education they receive. What if we could have kind of like bike highways, or recommended bike routes that were available to people? So people who are commuting north/south on the east maybe would use eastern ave, and then all the drivers who also commute on eastern would get accustomed to sharing with bikes. And if it wasnt just three bikes a day, if it was more like fifty, perhaps we could actually start seeing change.

Reminds me of social media and stuff, how you need a critical mass of people before they start adopting new norms and building a culture. It'd be great if we could use the population of bikers we have now instead of hoping and waiting that more people will start biking in the future so we can finally get change.","dietzdai","DaiLynn","Dietz","dietzdai@gmail.com","USER","2018-06-28 16:33:42",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/grand-rapids/explore/getting-around-ne/comments#!c-07c5807d0d927dcd0980f86024e5208b"
"getting-around-ne",,"Idaho Stop--yes please.

Group rides to increase awareness, street by street--truly a good idea. It will be tough to balance education with agitation, as a massive ride might aggravate drivers if executed during a high-volume portion of the day. Still, there is definitely something here.

Did anyone know about this Guaranteed Ride Home Program? (https://www.wmrideshare.org/guaranteed-ride). Basically, if you use alternative transportation and need an emergency ride home, you can get reimbursed up to $55 per use.

"streetcars-part-of-our-past-and-part-of-our-future",,"Quick hits: shorter distances with (hopefully) denser ridership, better public perception, preferred traffic flow, and more access to/from downtown.

While we do have things like the DASH and the free portion of the Silver Line, these still get caught up in traffic and seem unfortunately underutilized when looking at % of the population using them and other bus lines. 

I believe this has to do with the general perception of public transit. I think the novelty of a streetcar could break this stigma or at least open up some eyes to the Rapid's usefulness.

Additionally, streetcars typically have a real sense of traffic preference vs. BRT systems like the Silver Line. While there is technology on our Silver Line buses to hold traffic lights for them, I'm not sure how much authority these devices possess over the signals along Division or if they have any use at all when in the downtown loop. I say this because I've seen the bus signals they've installed on Fulton just west of Jefferson--why install this if the bus has the ability to decrease the length of the signal via proximity?

Lastly, any transit routes that are short yet efficient would theoretically spread the density of downtown horizontally, into nearby neighborhoods.

The church vans wasn't a Grand Rapids service, it was more the churches that knew transportation around GR was a problem provided a temporary solution.

"compelling-public-transit","DaiLynn, good question. The logistics necessary for transit to reach everyone is challenging. Time is convenience and convenience is King to consumers. Other distribution systems, like FedEx for instance, use infrastructure that can handle multiple distribution strategies simultaneously to accommodate a variety of consumer needs. But our road systems are designed for individual users which explains Ubers success while ideas like Ford's Chariot service have have struggled. The idea that I push for is a limited stop, non stop, multi-strategy Bus Rapid Transit system on highway or old rail corridors. Like FedEx packages, you would be rushed to transfer points nearest your destination to keep your stop and go service short. Simply providing side lanes at stops allowing limited stop service to merge in and out of a non stop corridor, much like a highway, provides infrastructure that can run multiple distribution strategies (limited stop, non stop to busy transfer hubs and direct to location service) simultaneously. As we know, the free market is teeming with companies trying to provide commuter services. Infrastructure designed for mass transit only can offer companies like Chariot, that provide direct to location services, the opportunity to purchase access rights to logistics that make their business model work. That not only gives the free market the opportunity to provide an array of services, it also can reduce the public investment necessary to make it work and provide public transit with another revenue source. Free market providers would be required to share data to help public transit focus on areas where service is subpar. While it's possible for public transit to improve commute times by simply running an overlapping distribution strategy of non stop shuttle services between transfer hubs spread across a region to compliment their stop and go route service, it's unlikely to compete with other mobility options, even during rush hours, without it's own infrastructure. I do have a website promoting this idea if you would like more information. It's generally directed towards my hometown market, but should have applications elsewhere.

"compelling-public-transit",,"Idrees, my apologies if I skipped a step in the process. I wasn't trying to offer an idea to the competition as I focus my comments towards changing the way public transit serves commuters to improve service and how it relates to DaiLynn perspective. My website and blog focus on transit strategies, infrastructure, generating revenue for public transit to solve funding issues and developing free markets that focus on mass transit instead of individual service.
Although I don't use my local transit often, I can offer an instance where it has worked for me. Every labor day we have a festival called Riverfest on the Ohio River in Cincinnati which ends with a fireworks show. It attracts about a half a million people and it is easy to get stuck in traffic leaving the event for about an hour. My son and I took a Transit shuttle to the event and after the fireworks ended we had a 5 minute walk to the bus and shuttled back to Northern Kentucky University about 10 miles away and were back in our car 20 minutes after the fireworks ended. It was amazing how well transit works when they can provide a distribution strategy that works for you.
Please feel free to delete my response to DaiLynn if it helps to focus the process and move things along. Best of luck to Ford and their Chariot service. Hopefully, one day, this idea will be embraced and offer services like Chariot the logistics and infrastructure needed to make it's business model work.","curtmail258","Curt","Parrott","curtmail258@yahoo.com","USER","2018-07-02 02:23:00",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/grand-rapids/explore/compelling-public-transit/comments#!c-addfa9b7e234254d26e9c7f2af1005cb"

"rails-to-trails-extend-fred-meijer-grand-river-valley-rail",,"Idrees,

I apologize that I missed the instructions regarding experiences before idea submissions. My family lives in Midtown and it's a great place to live, there are plenty of shops and restaurants/bars in the area, all within walking distance. My office is in Cascade and it takes me about 7 minutes to get to the gym in the morning near my office if I leave at an odd time such as 7:10am. When I come home from work at 5pm, it usually takes about 45 minutes due to traffic without any construction. With the major construction on 96 pushing traffic down 131 and onto I-96, even the morning at unusual times, traffic is at a standstill. I have tried to bike to work a few times, but it's extremely dangerous on Cascade, Fulton, Michigan Street and almost every other route available, as there are very few bikes lanes and many drivers.

When I leave my house in the morning, I drive over a set of railroad tracks that are hardly used near Eastern and Michigan. Then I cross them again on Fuller to get onto the highway, and then again when I get off on Fulton, and then again when I take Spaulding to Cascade. Crossing these tracks 10 times a day (or more) got me thinking of why they aren't utilized for public transportation. My family and I love going down to Riverside park (in our car) and take our bikes to ride up to Rockford for dinner using the White Pine Trail, which used to be railroad tracks. It's always full of people and some summer weekends it's almost faster to ride a bike to Rockford on a Friday night, rather than sit on the parking lot known as 131 North. The White Pines Trail ends at Riverside park but goes all the way up to Cadillac if you head north.

The Fred Meijer Grand River Trail is another trail that is nice to use for recreation, but requires transportation my vehicle to get to. It dead ends at the end of the tracks just west of Lowell. That track then runs through Grand Rapids and through Riverside park, over the river and connects to a few other sets. By converting this section of track and continuing the trail, you'll connect 10's of thousands of people to well over 100+ miles of trail without requiring them to drive. The trail could be used for recreation and commuters. There are plenty of parking lots available along them where people who don't live on or near the trail could park and walk or ride into downtown. Most summer days I see many medical professionals and students walking up Michigan to the Medical Mile even without any real organized trail. I think the city and it's residents could benefit tremendously from adding additional dedicated pedestrian pathways and the tracks that run from the White Pine trail to the Fred Meijer Grand River trail would be a perfect place to start with the most impact.","benz0515","Michael","Benz","benz0515@gmail.com","USER","2018-06-29 13:09:31",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/grand-rapids/explore/rails-to-trails-extend-fred-meijer-grand-river-valley-rail/comments#!c-e94550c93cd70fe748e6982b3439ad3b"

"pedestrian-underpasses-on-28th-st-and-other-busy-corridors",,"Thanks for facilitating, Idrees! When I cross 28th St, I am on the sidewalk, since the street is SO busy. Crossing means waiting, sometimes for quite a while. Sometimes it means heat radiating off pavement, with exhaust fumes from waiting cars. It means drivers who are turning trying to beat me, which, in turn, means cars behind them will go, too, not realizing there's a cyclist or pedestrian waiting to cross. It means constant vigilance. 

As for riding down 28th street over US131, that means a narrow sidewalk that butts right up against the street. The sidewalk has a large amount of gravel, which can be a hazard. Again, heat radiating off pavement and exhaust fumes. Then, there are two highway entrances to cross. There's a pedestrian button for crossing, but people aren't used to that light turning red, so often they run the red light. Again, constant vigilance is needed on my part. There's also a highway exit to cross, so I have three dangerous crossings in a very short distance.  This is actually a route fairly well-traveled by pedestrians since there are several by-the-month motels nearby, so I also have to watch for people walking and navigate around them. This can't even be biked in the winter since the sidewalks aren't passable and the street is simply to dangerous to ride on.

If have to think long and hard if I want to get to a destination across the highway badly enough to navigate this highly unpleasant section of road.","lmmuresan","Laura","Muresan","lmmuresan@yahoo.com","USER","2018-06-29 03:33:28","2018-06-29 03:36:22","https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/grand-rapids/explore/pedestrian-underpasses-on-28th-st-and-other-busy-corridors/comments#!c-df263d996281d984952c07998dc54358"

"uber-2-0-on-i-96",,"Hi, I drive a lot back and forth to Grand Rapids, and Detroit. I find it difficult to go back and forth and used up my gas then work in other city. What I think is to have car pool lots expand for Uber to use for pick up and drop off spot. Eventually , it will be ready for more growth next stage put improving the system by new add on. In next decade who knows someone will come with a concept of changing highways to self driving monorails to get less cars in  highway, repairs made to highway, and no need to expand highways! 

When having a big hub in major cities we should have on placed inside and outside. Monorail would connect to outside of cities and inside have many options to use in one hub. We don’t need to make changes around cities for different type of transportations. Hub could add bike rental, information center, ticket booth, restaurant (fast food), train, bus station. 

It sure is fustrated looking for perfect spot spot to park and pick up or drop off passengers is extremely unsafe or police can ticket Drivers for dropping or picking up at say The Bob,. Struggle to making a clean flow getting into and out of city would need to different stations along the routes.  Uber would have map of downtown on our Drivers app showing path we must follow to get to one station is a nice streaming flow of Uber drivers  in same path at all time. We would see stations to pick up say 1 on Fulton and Monroe. The station  had easy access to Uber app on main screen. Since sometime passenger’s phone battery died and the station is back up.  

Since GR is becoming a beer city, we need more streamline of pick up that allow us exit downtown to get other brewery within the flow of Uber Brewery  (driverless car).

Thanks for your comments about transit, driving, walking and biking! I see several ideas embedded in there which will be useful when we get to the “Propose” phase of this project in a few weeks (https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/content/how-it-works).

You make several points:
1. Transit ridership is down and automobile congestion is worse because more of us are driving cars in an improving economy.
2. Bus-only lanes contribute to automobile congestion.
3. Demand-based pricing for parking would reduce automobile congestion downtown.
Is that a fair summary?
It sounds like you've been frustrated by the bus-only lanes during peak commute times on South Division. Can you tell us more about what you've observed?

Lets make more efficient use of those bus lanes. There should also be congestion pricing for single-occupancy vehicles (including driverless) to help manage the congestion. Better biking infrastructure also encourages an alternative to single-occupancy (motorized) vehicles.

Congestion pricing for single-occupancy vehicles is a ludicrous big city idea that is not needed for Grand Rapids and most likely never will be.  That is great that you &quot;shouldn't need a vehicle&quot; Rob, but many of us do need and also want a vehicle.  I am all for spending money on public services that would reduce congestion.

However,  I also have to much to even be allowed to use some transportation services for a fee.    Unless there is something that I am unaware of,  there needs to be transportation available to all range of income seniors.   Perhaps it could be on a sliding scale for fees…..not sure who would administrate that or the cost to provide a service to include all.    I can use the EMS transfer vans for medical appointments provided by the ambulances for a cost but I am not that unhealthy to require that level of service.   Location of doctor offices, churches, shopping are not convenient when a person does not drive or have the ability to walk long distances.    And that does not even include other quality of life activities locations to keep a senior from being isolated.

"senior-transportation","Hello Annie and Carole, I have too experienced the senior transportation deficit that the Grand Rapids area currently has when trying to transport my grandparents. To create a healthier community I started Ride YourWay LLC - a Non-Emergency Medical Transportation company. We specialize in transporting seniors and those who require wheelchair-assistance to their medical appointments, leisure activities, and anything else they might enjoy! 

I am also in school to become a nurse so I wanted to create a more personalized experience for our clients - something that is MUCH different from standard modes of public transportation, ambulance services, and Uber/Lyft. 

We have also made our rides safer by utilizing special restraint equipment, training procedures, and CPR/BLS certified drivers. Also, we wanted to create a more personalized experience by a unique wheelchair-accessible van that allows wheelchairs to lock into the front passenger area - something that is not otherwise seen in the industry. 

Better yet, our rides are anywhere from 45%-75% more affordable than standard ambulance services in Grand Rapids!

We're here and would love to assist you!",,"t_sikkem","Thomas","Sikkema","t_sikkem@yahoo.com","USER","2018-07-24 04:13:54",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/grand-rapids/explore/senior-transportation/comments#!c-a501bebf79d570651ff601788ea9d16d"

"make-streets-easier-to-cross",,"You're welcome, Tom! I also ride my bike on Kalamazoo quite a bit (only for a short stretch), but use the sidewalk there. I'd love bike lanes there! My pedestrian experience on Kalamazoo is actually a cyclist trying to walk a bike across the street. 

As for my experience with road diets, the only one of those streets I ever drive on is Burton (and that, rarely, since I'm usually biking). Personally, as a cyclist and occasional driver, I haven't had a problem with it in places where it is, but find the intersections are bit tricky for a cyclist. My least favorite part, though, is how it ends abruptly near Breton. A road diet I really, really like as a cyclist and don't mind as a driver is Jefferson. I ride that way frequently and it is my favorite route (I also love that it is flat and shaded). 

Back to Burton: that is another road that could really do with more crosswalks. I don't think there are any between Eastern and Madison. I live near Eastern and 28th and ride my bike downtown regularly. I usually take Union and have to cross Burton. Sometimes that takes a really long time to cross. If there were a crosswalk, I'd get off my bike and walk across so I wouldn't have to wait as long. Sometimes it takes a couple of minutes to find a chance to go (it's still better than Kalamazoo, though, since there are fewer lanes of traffic to cross). Maybe crosswalks should be entirely abolished, and anywhere a pedestrian is waiting to cross, cars have to stop to let them go.","lmmuresan","Laura","Muresan","lmmuresan@yahoo.com","USER","2018-07-06 02:09:29",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/grand-rapids/explore/make-streets-easier-to-cross/comments#!c-e5e63da79fcd2bebbd7cb8bf1c1d0274"

The day I got home, there was a nasty, cold rain and I rode my bike in it until I got to another bus route that ran that day.

"too-many-parking-lots",,"Hey what's up <Utom><Tom Bulten>&nbsp;!

I had included a link to a video from vox but it seems to be missing from my original post 
( https://www.vox.com/videos/2017/7/19/15993936/high-cost-of-free-parking )

I hadn't seen that other post, which is interesting. Personally, whenever I've had to drive downtown I've always parked in one of the structures and i've never felt I was paying too much. But normally if I'm going downtown I do it by bike exclusively.

I was thinking in terms of the sprawl areas like <Ulmmuresan><Laura Muresan>&nbsp;mentioned. I work over by the airport and cutting through the businesses near 28th st. (and it's over-sized unoccupied parking lot) got me thinking this morning. 

When it comes to parking downtown, does lack of parking mean at their destination, near their destination, or as far as they're willing to walk to their destination? Would the addition of more ramps as well as adding on to the skywalk alleviate some of this? Because the skywalk of Grand Rapids is awesome, but it's wayyyyyyyyyy too short. Whenever I hear about a lack of parking downtown I remember the GIANT lot near Charley's Crab &amp; The Van Andel. A structure there, for instance could handle the load of the Van Andel and Charley's Crab and still open up enough room for more new development. 

When it comes to parking structures, and I know I'm going a little off topic here, I'd rather see the ground levels of them be commercial &amp; retail spaces so we're not dedicating the space just to parking. 

Winter commuting for me is non-existant because I work near 44th &amp; the Beltline which is the worst area to commute to by bike (in my opinion). 

Winter Bicycle Commuting in general can be a challenge
Bike lanes are hard to spot and not often cleared. If you haven't set aside the money for a specific winter bike, it can cause a lot of damage to the regular bicycle especially if the lanes aren't clear and ice &amp; salt are building up in the gears. 

The other challenge of winter bicycle commuting is that it's not always the easiest for the employee. Bike friendly businesses are great and help improve our standing in the bike friendly cities ranking (tourism points) but in order to qualify the businesses need to hit a certain criteria, which would include bike storage, changing &amp; showering facilities, employee incentives and other things which make life a little easier for the bike commuter. But a lack of these things in the winter time compound the already difficult nature of biking in the winter time (IMO).","themightybuzz","Craig","Richards","themightybuzz@gmail.com","USER","2018-07-06 20:17:38","2018-07-06 21:28:14","https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/grand-rapids/explore/too-many-parking-lots/comments#!c-9c3b1830513cc3b8fc4b76635d32e692"

"too-many-parking-lots",,"I think a lack of parking means a lack of free parking, or lack of really cheap parking. Those who want to park might be trying to find the cheapest spots first. That means driving around the block a few times. If the cheapest spots (meters, especially meters after hours) are taken or hard to find, then it gives these people the impression that it's hard to park downtown. If all the spots in a general vicinity were the same price, regardless of whether or not it's a meter or a lot, people might learn to go straight to the parking ramp. In a way, I think it's not that there's not enough parking, it's that there are too many options, which makes it overwhelming, just like the toothpaste aisle.","lmmuresan","Laura","Muresan","lmmuresan@yahoo.com","USER","2018-07-06 21:22:32",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/grand-rapids/explore/too-many-parking-lots/comments#!c-0eec27c419d0fe24e53c90338cdc8bc6"

"too-many-parking-lots","I feel similarly, Craig! Can we tear down the whole of 28th St and start again? I live on the SE side, but rode down Plainfield today, and was impressed by the nice bike lanes and the appealing business district. I didn't see a whole lot of parking lots, but businesses seemed to be thriving. Two of the places I stopped in the Creston neighborhood today, though, didn't have bike racks (at least not by the front doors); one of them, ironically, was Switchback Gear Exchange. 

Tom, I have a thought about winter bike commuting: I think the first hurdle is to get people to commute by bike when the weather is nice; people like to use winter as an excuse not to commute during more pleasant weather. Once someone becomes a committed bike commuter, there's at least a reasonable chance they'll keep riding when the weather gets iffy. Some companies offer their workers incentives not to drive, and winter biking gear might make a nice incentive. The number of people who could commute by bike (or who think they could) is significantly limited by how far people live from work. The way society is now, with employees tending not to work the same job for decades, people probably don't feel the need to live close to work like they might've in the past, since--who knows?--they might be at a different job next year anyway. So, unless more people work from home or something can be done to keep them at the same jobs longer, large scale bicycle commuting, in any weather, is probably a pipe dream.",,"lmmuresan","Laura","Muresan","lmmuresan@yahoo.com","USER","2018-07-06 18:58:09",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/grand-rapids/explore/too-many-parking-lots/comments#!c-b59c67bf196a4758191e42f76670ceba"

Thank you for your insight.  We believe strongly in Grand Rapids' ability and legacy of always being able to somehow &quot;do the impossible&quot; and to overcome those obstacles that other cities would submit to as insurmountable unattainabilities (i.e. - reinventing a downtown to become the urban hub between Chicago and Detroit that did not roll up at 5:15p, creating a bus system that people would use after 6:00p and on Sundays, building an arena that would be in the top 100 revenue-generating arenas of the world, positioning an airport to approach 3-million annual users in 2019, growing a university that would eclipse Western as West Michigan's largest university, growing a world-class biomedical hub with a research institute AND Michigan State University's medical school, positioning such a conglomeration and its 1.3 million residents to be 25-35 minutes from 47 miles of ocean-like beachfront, from Michigan's Adventure rollercoasters and from a growing casino complex to boot).

We have all of the basic elements to attain the first part of this region's central theme and moniker: GRAND.  To go forward in ways that do not reflect GRAND (i.e. - bold, superlative, great, inspiring, beyond, etc.) is to set Metro GR up for continuing to be the butt of &quot;small&quot;-, &quot;backwater&quot;- and &quot;Hooterville&quot;-associated jokes that always end in would-be newcomers taking the option of another new place that actually goes about achieving GRANDness.

We Michiganians of Metro GRAND just need to continue our trademark of reaching higher and overcoming self-doubt as we always have.  GO GRAND!

"we-live-work-in-michigan-s-second-largest-city-boundaries-but-still-own-two-cars-why","Thanks for the great posts, Meagen! We used to have two cars. My husband and I were both musicians that traveled out of town a lot, sometimes at the same time. For us, we decided maybe we could live with one car by borrowing a parent's car when we had things at the same time (since they also provided the babysitting for us - what moochers we were!) When we finally did it, we found that we could take fewer gigs and avoid the ones that conflicted with one another because we didn't need to earn as much money since we weren't maintaining two vehicles. I eventually quit my work as a musician entirely and am now self-employed from home. I think perhaps that choosing a convenient place to live and choosing transportation first, then choosing work to fit around it, may be the easiest way to make it work. We live in Alger Heights; though it's not as cool as Eastown or some of the other neighborhoods near downtown, it is a very practical neighborhood. We have Ken's Fruit Market and a hardware store a short walk away, a Meijer a short bike ride away, and many other everyday businesses and a library nearby. If my husband weren't a freelance musician, we could get by with no car, even. We ride our bikes far more than we drive, and are also blessed to be within a block of two bus lines. We didn't plan it this way, but we are quite happy with how our living / transportation situation has turned out, and, knowing this, I think it would be worth planning a job around. We have a pretty low-cost lifestyle, so neither my husband nor I have to work full time, which gives us a nice life-work balance, and also helps out a lot with childcare; I can plan what I'm doing around when my husband has to work.",,"lmmuresan","Laura","Muresan","lmmuresan@yahoo.com","USER","2018-07-11 02:04:19",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/grand-rapids/explore/we-live-work-in-michigan-s-second-largest-city-boundaries-but-still-own-two-cars-why/comments#!c-6e79ed05baec2754e25b4eac73a332d2"

I think the neighbors who have been here long term downtown have done a lot of work to hold down the fort - so to speak. Meanwhile, a lot of us college students fell in love with our college homes and once we got our first jobs and could swing it post-recession, decided to move into this area. The return of commercial storefronts and restaurants has drawn people who may not typically come downtown to our neighborhoods - storefronts that sat vacant for decade(s). In 2004 when we lived where we do, there wasn't even a quarter of the options that we have today. This is not the forum to discuss diversity and inequality but I don't want to discount those major issues too - there's definitely a market that the renaissance has returned for and unfortunately it's resulted in us losing a lot of the neighbors that we had just 5 years ago. But regarding mobility: the storefronts have brightened sidewalk spaces day and night and allowed local neighbors and suburban visitors to come in and enjoy the area. Walking, running and biking neighbors are every 3 minutes or less when I sit on my front porch. But you know what else there is? Folks speeding down our street in vehicles from the speed bump to the corner. Speeding down streets that have parallel parking on both sides and children and dogs playing in front yards. I can't express enough how concerning it is. I'd love to see traffic calming solutions come to every street of downtown and remind people that we live here before someone is hurt.","meagen.coburn","Meagen","Coburn","meagen.coburn@gmail.com","USER","2018-07-10 15:29:56",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/grand-rapids/explore/michigan-is-rooted-in-vehicle-manufacturing-how-do-we-break-that-deep-rooted-need-that-we-all-grew-up-on-and-move-to-pedestrian-first/comments#!c-cd14821dab219ea06e2fd1a2df2e3582"

"grand-rapids-has-been-designed-vehicle-first-how-do-we-undo-this-infrastructure",,"One other thing about bike commuting that I've noticed: it saves far more money than just the cost of operating a motor vehicle. Because I don't do much that can't be accomplished by bike (or the occasional bus trip), I do very little shopping outside the neighborhood, and virtually no recreational shopping. Before getting rid of my car, it was an entirely different story. It really changed my perspective about where I wanted to go. Our family still has a car that I can use if I really want to, but the habit of taking the bike is fully formed, so I really avoid trips that need a car. We got rid of &quot;my&quot; car about 12 years ago; it took a number of years of gradual change for me to get to the point where I actually wish my husband would agree to get rid of the family car. Most people aren't going to jump into something like this cold turkey.

Circling back to the original contribution: I think if more people rode their bikes, there'd be more political will to make good bike infrastructure. It seems like, when people started wanting to drive, the infrastructure was built to accommodate them, and as it was built, it just exacerbated the mess. As cars made it harder to bike or walk way back when, I wouldn't cry if bikes, walking, and transit were to make it harder to drive today (an example of this is the new law in GR that you have to stop for pedestrians in crosswalks, lights being timed for buses, or road diets to accommodate bike lanes); enough things that make it easier for those who aren't in cars in relation to those who are in cars could make a tipping point come sooner, where alternative transportation seems like a viable option to the average person.

Only when it becomes more difficult to shop, for instance, outside of a neighborhood than in it, will most neighborhood business districts thrive.","lmmuresan","Laura","Muresan","lmmuresan@yahoo.com","USER","2018-07-15 04:42:12","2018-07-15 05:00:41","https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/grand-rapids/explore/grand-rapids-has-been-designed-vehicle-first-how-do-we-undo-this-infrastructure/comments#!c-56f9f88906aebf4ad985aaec7fa01313"

The construction season this particular summer (esp with Wealthy/131/Division being closed in conjunction with StudioPark construction cluster) it has made it such that I would SO prefer staying within our own &quot;burrough&quot; boundary if only I could. Instead, even last night I found myself having to go up to Alpine for the closest full-service stores for baby food, diaper cream, new flats (shoes) for me, and two makeup items. I just couldn't have done it at 6PM any closer than Alpine. But man the drive up there - even though it's only a simple six miles from our home - was brutal. We wanted an air conditioned dinner (we don't have air at home and the heat is getting to us, so Chipotle near Target) and I guess the drive up there in the air conditioned vehicle was fine but it took us longer to commute there and back than it did to actually run into the grocery store.","meagen.coburn","Meagen","Coburn","meagen.coburn@gmail.com","USER","2018-07-17 20:42:30",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/grand-rapids/explore/grand-rapids-has-been-designed-vehicle-first-how-do-we-undo-this-infrastructure/comments#!c-519c84155964659375821f7ca576f095"

Portions of it are pretty pedestrian-friendly for the type of street it is. It's unpleasant under any circumstances due to the amount of traffic, though the sidewalks are really quite nice in Kentwood, Grand Rapids, and most of Wyoming. But in Grandville it's the pits. The one nice piece of 28th St pedestrian infrastructure in Grandville, an old pedestrian bridge over the road, was taken down a few years ago. Recently there was a new master plan (or something like that) for streets in Grand Rapids, and 28th St has been designated a high traffic car / truck route, so there will be no bike lanes put in, and it sounds like no plans for better pedestrian infrastructure.","lmmuresan","Laura","Muresan","lmmuresan@yahoo.com","USER","2018-07-13 01:43:38",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/grand-rapids/explore/28th-st-in-grandville-highly-pedestrian-bike-unfriendly/comments#!c-069654d5ce089c13f642d19f09a3d1c0"

"parking-so-many-spots-yet-not-affordable","Thanks for sharing Annie, service workers do need access to downtown but if the cost of parking is prohibitive I could see this creating an issue with access to work. Parking can be expensive to build in a downtown, and this is a cost often internalized by employers who do provide free parking to employees. For both of these reasons I think downtown districts would be better off if there were convenient alternatives. One concept I have heard before is employers allowing employees to receive cash rather than the free parking spot, so they have an incentive to find alternative modes if possible: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2017/03/17/d-c-wants-employers-to-pay-workers-not-to-drive-to-work/?utm_term=.cb2594d58afd",,"idrees","Idrees","Mutahr","idrees@100open.com","ADMIN","2018-07-18 02:10:34",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/grand-rapids/explore/parking-so-many-spots-yet-not-affordable/comments#!c-03e7d2ebec1e820ac34d054df7e68f48"

"bicycle-action-plan","I read it (I didn't read all the appendices, but I read the plan). I like what I read. I'm definitely interested in hearing from others who might better understand the ramifications of it, especially for cyclists. I looked on Facebook to see what GGRBC or other bicycle advocacy groups had to say about it, but didn't see anything. I will say, when Eastern Ave was reworked in Alger Heights a couple of years ago, I was sorely disappointed to see that, aside from one pedestrian refuge in the business district, not much happened to make the area more bicycle- or pedestrian-friendly.

I was happy to read that the City would like to replace an exiting traffic engineer with one that has experience creating successful cycling infrastructure. The City's efforts to get a Bicycle-Friendly City designation, and to try to improve upon the current Bronze designation it has recently received impressed me, too. I am excited for the future of cycling in GR, though my excitement is somewhat tempered by the lackluster improvements to Eastern Ave.

The Plan also mentioned adding more Bike Route signs a number of times; however, I'm also not sure how helpful they are. I've seen them in places, but because it's not clear where they go in relation to where I actually want to go, I haven't found them particularly helpful and am not sure I really understand what they do that Google satellite view doesn't do. My street would get a BIke Route sign, though, which is kind of cool.",,"lmmuresan","Laura","Muresan","lmmuresan@yahoo.com","USER","2018-07-18 04:36:42","2018-07-18 14:26:08","https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/grand-rapids/explore/bicycle-action-plan/comments#!c-d77f00766fd3be3f2189c843a6af3fb2"

Based off my personal experience I know many of those people choose to Uber or Lyft into the area or they walk. Just sit and watch the volume of rideshare traffic in that area. Which makes me wonder if the congestion over in that area isn't necessarily from all the bars and restaurant patronage,  but the new apartments that are over in that area that stack up behind all of those buildings as well as From the restaurant workers and bar workers that need to park... And, When those workers leave late at night those shuttles aren't running to get them to the cars that would be parked in the lots.  Fratelies, the pizza place is the smallest establishment sometimes has 8 to 10 workers who all drive seperately ... Imagine 200 to 300 workers competing for spaces as well as people who live there.  The lot under the express way.. across from the Ford  museum is largely unused. Why not designate that as employee parking and have security monitor it for safety.  Make it free.

"transit-grocery","Hi Connie: I'm one of the facilitators here on the forum. Thanks for raising the important issue of groceries and transportation--especially for transit users. Can you point us to photos of transit-oriented grocery stores that you've seen? I think your timing with this post is good. We've been exploring stories and experiences about mobility in Grand Rapids. Next week the City of Tomorrow Challenge is expecting to move to the &quot;Propose&quot; phase, seeking ideas that could be tried here.

"transit-grocery","Not only could it catch people making transfers, but it could be a destination in and of itself, since all &quot;roads&quot; (or, rather, almost all the bus lines) lead to it. Even getting the YMCA Veggie Van parked there (on the platform, where people can see it, rather than in the front of the building) could be helpful. Another benefit of a shop placed there is that people wouldn't have to carry their purchases far, because they're already at the stop.

If I lease out my trek and it comes back damaged who pays and how do you collect. 

What if the bike is stolen while someone is leading it.  Lock is cut... (fairly common problem in gr)

What if someone gets hurt while riding my bike can they sue me?",,"annie.young","annie","young","annie.young@kboose.com","USER","2018-07-22 15:57:31",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/grand-rapids/explore/implement-a-home-grown-dockless-peer-to-eer-bike-sharing-network-using-open-source-technology/comments#!c-ea6b2efbdd4255a9f1b3bbc6399b58f4"

You can opt to add insurance to your bike similar like HyreCar.com (which rents out your car exclusively for Uber/Lyft).

re: Liability: 

Here is Jump Bikes' rental agreement, they were recently bought out by Uber for $200 million  ; https://jumpbikes.com/rental-agreement/ where the rider assumes all risk when renting their bikes and agree to waive all liability. Typical in this case.

Key question is whether you want a megacorp to run your bike sharing network or try and sustain one from within the community.","varun","Varun","Adibhatla","varun@argolabs.org","USER","2018-07-22 17:19:54",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/grand-rapids/explore/implement-a-home-grown-dockless-peer-to-eer-bike-sharing-network-using-open-source-technology/comments#!c-3a824154b16ed7dab899bf000b80eeee"

"getting-groceries-home","Shipt offers a service that delivers, and given I dont see shopping carts from forest hills foods plopped around cascade and forest hills, I am making the presumption this is a challenge that is more common in our inner city.

So if you dont have a car, cant afford shipt or an uber  and your not able to phone a friend how do you get groceries home to  feed your families. 
 Is it possible that we hand out portable carts for recycling points...or walking/ riding points if we develop such a system.  

I dont think everyone charging for carts will fix the issues. Perhaps portable carts could be for sale at grocery and dollar stores....",,"annie.young","annie","young","annie.young@kboose.com","USER","2018-07-22 15:40:14","2018-07-22 15:50:56","https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/grand-rapids/explore/getting-groceries-home/comments#!c-84ddfb34126fc3a48ee38d7044e87276"
"getting-groceries-home",,"It definitely seems to be more of an inner city issue - but not too inner city, since there are fewer grocery stores there. The Aldi system is excellent because it encourages people not to take the carts away, but if they do, someone else will take them back to get the deposit. I do see people with collapsible shopping carts get on buses fairly frequently, so some people see them as a solution to the problem, but not everyone. Dollar Tree at 28th and Eastern has recently added the quarter deposit thingies to their shopping carts, so some stores other than Aldi are trying this as a solution. I think more people would spring for the collapsible carts (they're not expensive) if it weren't so ridiculously easy just to take a cart off the store grounds.","lmmuresan","Laura","Muresan","lmmuresan@yahoo.com","USER","2018-07-22 17:01:09",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/grand-rapids/explore/getting-groceries-home/comments#!c-05a5cf06982ba7892ed2a6d38fe832d6"
