I have many ideas to help alleviate traffic, but here are the best ones:
1. Incentivize people to carpool. It is sad to see how many 5 seat cars are sitting in traffic with only a driver inside. People respond to perks, like special parking garages or freebies or super gas discounts for particpating in carpooling. 
2. Turn US-1 from Brickell to Southland Mall into a double decker expressway with limited exits, like the turnpike. This will seperate the long-coastal commuters from local traffic. People will happily pay a toll for this.
3. Install smart traffic lights at every intersection of the city. I cant tell you how wasteful it is to be sitting at a red light for minutes when nobody is coming through the intersection. Our intersections are not timed correctly, and do not take into account real time traffic. 
4. Build a tunnel under the Miami River at Brickell Avenue. 
5. Cut the amount of time wasted on road construction by hiring firms who will employ larger numbers of workers to get jobs done sooner and more efficiently.","104","4","2","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-13 16:25:52",,"2018-06-13 16:25:52","2018-06-13 18:53:46","2018-06-13 16:34:20",,,,"2018-06-13 16:25:52","2018-06-16 12:06:15","2018-06-13 23:50:39",,,"4","2","0","0","0","4","2","0","0","0","2018-06-13 18:53:46","2018-06-13 16:34:20",,,"2018-06-16 12:06:15","2018-06-13 23:50:39",,,"4","2","0","0","0"

Miami transit is currently suffering from a ridership decline, this idea would reverse the trend by making transit-based travel free or subsided for the clear majority of riders.

How?
Riders would install an app on their mobile device that the would log into with Facebook or email. Once they are logged in, they would link their EASYcard and select the transit item the would like to “purchase”. To “purchase” a transit ticket a user would simply select the desired ticket and watch a 2< minute interactive video from the sponsor. This process would be repeated any time the user would like to use transit.

Who?
Any Miami Dade Transit or Tri-Rail customer with a mobile device.

When?
6-12 months to develop the platform and sign up sponsors

Summary:

This sponsored ride app would benefit a large amount of people in an extremely cost-effective way
Riders: Free or subsidized transit

First priority is how to finance any solution that is feasible and sustainable—I propose $1/gallon tax to fund transit infrastructure improvements offset by savings in time/energy/money.

If on average American drivers consume 656 gallons per person per annum x 6 million people x $1 tax / gallon (25% increase in current gas prices) = approximately $4B per annum to fund smart transit—optimization of routes, lights/signals, modes of transit over the coming years. Said increase in tax would encourage more ride shares, public transit and fewer/consolidation of trip frequency (i.e., going to the grocery store once a week vs daily or planning optional trips during not peak traffic times). Encourage employers to offer flex work schedules and business flexible hours (for example dentist or doctor hours noon-9pm, government offices staggered shifts for employees and operating hours to spread to smooth out traffic peaks & valleys).

Don’t tax Peter to pay Paul, but across the board increase the fuel tax to improve transit infrastructure for planes, trains and automobiles.

I'm sure that they'll strongly disagree with me, but lets face the facts, NOTHING has been constructively accomplished in the last twenty years and more, to alleviate traffic congestion in a meaningful, quantifiable way. One of the biggest problems is that they are very short sighted individuals who can't seem to look towards the future when it comes to planning. Our Miami traffic history can attest to that. I remember reading somewhere about a master traffic plan that was developed in the late sixties or early seventy's that mentioned a railway running along the Dolphin expressway East from downtown Miami West to Florida International University and then South through the Turnpike to Florida City- nothing ever came of it. We all know how expensive a railway system is to build and to maintain, but why not then implement a bus system using the same route? A combination of express buses and local stop buses that run on a tight and varying schedule in accordance with ""rush hour' demands.
We are currently undergoing a flurry of new highway bridges construction and adding more lanes to re-mediate  that which should have been implemented a long time ago.  One problem, shortsightedness again.","51","1","1","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-13 22:47:05","2018-06-13 22:49:40","2018-06-13 22:47:05","2018-06-13 23:03:13","2018-06-14 13:10:00",,,"2018-06-13 22:49:40","2018-06-13 22:47:05","2018-06-13 23:03:13","2018-06-14 13:10:00",,,"1","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","2018-06-13 23:03:13","2018-06-14 13:10:00",,,"2018-06-13 23:03:13","2018-06-14 13:10:00",,,"1","1","0","0","0"

If no cars are making lefts, then the sensors will inform the camera to prioritize time for regular green light vehicles. Another instance a sensor will be used will be continue having green lights for vehicles when the intersecting road traffic lights do not sense any vehicles.
Other ideas to improve traffic flow:
1. Educating drivers on what to do with non life threatening accidents. And clearing the roads after a crash.
2. Creating a user friendly app that will connect drivers to a network on road activities and shortcuts they recommend. 
3. A ""diagonal"" super highway stretching from homestead to Aventura. Our existing ""east west, north south approach is not gas or time efficient.

Down the main avenues of his city there is a train or some may call it a trolley. It goes up and down the avenues and It gets people to where they need to go without having to deal with traffic. The main goal should be to get as many people out of their vehicles as possible. The current locations of the metro rail and Tri-Rail  stations are simply too far from residential areas.    Four years many of the residents have been complaining about the limited real options in our city. If the rail lines simply extended toward the beach down on main street’s, of which there are only about five or six, this would alleviate a ton of traffic and frustration amongst drivers.  The rail could also go up and down Collins Avenue also known as A1A.   So many of our residents work either on the beach or in downtown. Driving to and from those areas, being only several miles from the highway, take over an hour to reach getting in during the morning rush hour and leaving during the afternoon rush.  There also aren’t enough dedicated bicycle lanes. I say this because in some areas the bike lanes are shared with Road traffic and people here in Miami have no respect for bicycle riders. I’ve seen too many cyclists have close calls with vehicle because of desperate drivers.

Such is life when the world’s populations keeps increasing. Now in Miami’s case, as opposed to Finland as an example, we have a driver education/preparation system that is frankly a joke. A basic Drug and a alcohol course, easy little driving test and you have a license. Many come to Miami without ever really learning the rules of the road nor to we have a grip on their driving skills. My suggestion would be to revamp the driver education system and model it similar to that of Germany where they have the autobahn where you drive as fast as you want and yet they still have lower number of fatalities proportionally. Another good addititon to our roadways would be to implement roundabouts to increase the flown of traffic within cities. On top of that, Miami has a very inefficient public transport system. We need more buses , more routes for the metro rail system, more efficient trains where people would then be encouraged to leave their cars in favor of the benefits of using unlicensed transport(saves them from spending money on gas, depreciation from adding mileage on the cars, stress factor from sitting in traffic with the uneducated driver population in the city, among many other factors). Ultimately the solution really is to improve the driver education and preparation systems maybe implement some tactics used in countries like Germany and Finland. Then it’s just improving public transport.","62","0","1","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-14 02:05:09",,"2018-06-14 02:05:09",,"2018-06-15 04:15:55",,,,"2018-06-14 02:05:09",,"2018-06-15 04:15:55",,,"0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0",,"2018-06-15 04:15:55",,,,"2018-06-15 04:15:55",,,"0","1","0","0","0"

Roundabouts are used all over the world to keep the flow of traffic moving ...unlike red lights which lock up traffic like a blood clot in a clogged artery. I think a roundabout ""SYSTEM"" can best serve a crowded city with no room to grow. A roundabout system doesnt have to be your typical roundabout in circular form for this would be extremely costly to construct. My idea of a system would just to be not allowing four way crossings at every single intersection, rather one way turn only turns with a roundabout lane a mile or less down the road so you can turn to your desired direction. This would eliminate long stops at red lights and best way to attempt to keep the flow of traffic moving. The cost would also not be as much as constructing typical r/a's with only small road modifications required. These could be built and designed all over Miami-Dade county after realizing where the heaviest backups take place. This would be a little annoying to the drivers who will have to go a little way out of there way, but in the long term will save gas, electrical energy on the power grid by reducing the amount of signal lights, and most importantly time by reducing the amount of time spent behind red lights.

I’m originally from Miami and it is no secret the majority of the traffic is work related. In this day in age and even with more sophisticated tools, it is difficult for most companies to let go of having everyone report to the office, even if it means two full hours of unproductive time on the road. I think Ford could take a leadership role to partner with local businesses and encourage them to take a hard look at what employees and job roles could reasonably be done remotely.  Each company would need to apply some common sense guidelines to ensure it does not negatively impact their business. I feel the immediate fix is to change our habits first before developing other transportation alternatives which are likely to be high in capital investment. Ford could identify those local business that have the most people reporting to work in the most congested areas and work together to solve the traffic problem for the community. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if we make a concerted effort to reduce traffic, entrust more employees to work remotely and also realize business gains through increased productivity?  The energy industry has learned over the years that it is less costly to reduce consumption then to build more power plants - let’s do the same to make a significant and sustainable improvement for Miami’s traffic.

Reason I'm saying this. Every year when classes finish. Traffic lightens up even on the mayor highway's. As soon as school starts it goes back to the horror of parking lots on the major highways.

Another way they can relief bad traffic that wont be as cost effective. Is to have a schedule where school traffic doesnt interfere with the daily commuters that go to work and back.

Most classes start between 7:30am - 8:30am. As well as many have to be at work between 7am - 9am. If they worked a way to go around this.

It leads because it never ever gets to close the car in front of the highway but never brakes completely to keep the flow “fluid” enough to trick our perceptions of drivers that traffic isn’t all that bad.  Part of this idea is manipulating the perception of traffic by having ford car lead and pace the traffic accordingly so that we don’t waste gas, stick shift cars can at least stay in 2nd gear, and people won’t get late to work on highway if they don’t check the news or radio for an accident .

When you first hear it, it will sound nuts and not make sense. However, the more you think about it, the more you realize it is probably the quickest viable solution and could be implemented in about 5 years if everyone is on board.
As a civil/structural engineer with a Master’s degree (not showing off, but so you know I speak with knowledge on the subject), I genuinely feel that a Sky Tram System is the solution.  There will be many people opposing it (like 95 express and MDX  I’m sure..although it would be amazing if they jumped on board) , work rerouting electric lines (put them underground at these locations) and bridges, but I think it will solve the actual issue of transportation and it is suitable for our terrain.
Florida has 1000 people moving here per day!  The roads just can’t handle it any more.  Miami has to make a shift towards using less cars like other major cities.
The skyline is one of the things people will say it ruins….and yes, it will make a big visual impact.  But just like Venice has it’s gondolas as the means of travel, New York famous for its Subway and San Francisco its street cars; Miami can be famous for its Sky Tram (or whatever you so choose to call it).  I know Medellin in Colombia has had one for many years and it is very successful.

If we get the East coast of Miami off the highways we can definitely help Miami citizens arrive to work on time and the East citizens can enjoy a nice view on their way to work or even get some work done on the way to downtown. The Miami River can also be taken as another route of travel for the service. To make this service possible the rider's experience must be taken into huge importance. The boats must be able to travel in rain and be readily available, meaning the service will require several boats. The riders must be able to have a better ride experience than that of their own car or of a car ride sharing service. If we empower individuals to get some work done prior to reaching their destination or coordinate tasks without the need to focus on the road we will have a more efficient population. The production of several boats can be manipulated with 3D printing. Low cost manufacturing will allow several boats to be produced in the USA and create jobs in Miami. 

This service will be great for Miami residents that are near a coast or a drive away from a coast. If the coast is too much of a hassle it might be better to drive using existing infrastructure.

Everything from registration to insurance can be processed and alert traffic officers in the area.   The state needs to also make an inspection every 2 years for vehicles to ensure road worthiness to keep from breakdowns on 95s.   The biggest issue that causes congestion on 95s is people lane hogging and utilizing the passing lane then moving back right.  This causes the 99.95% of all accidents in Florida if not all over the USA.  Because of this drivers pass on the right lanes to go around slower moving traffic.  Maybe digital traffic reminders via sync and media displays could be implemented to remind drivers to move to the right.  Cars have seat belt minders for safety, now is the time to have bad driving habit minders to encourage good driving behavior.     Lastly parking is a huge issue of drivers circling blocks over and over and stopping and going.   Digitally reserved parking spaces and times could be utilized with multi car elevator parking spaces for reservations.   The solution is easier than it seems.  It's the legislation and enforcement that needs to be encouraged.  Left lane passing only is already a law.  It really needs to be enforced.

The issue with traffic is that when you're at a light not all cars accelerate at the same time therefore causing backup and affecting the amount of cars to pass. Instead roads should be places on a treadmill system in which lets say the road is 500 ft but the treadmill would move these cars to the next road within 30 seconds of the light being green so all cars in the 250 ft of the road (the section where the treadmill was built) would move these cars forward, left or right.

Promoción del uso de la bicicleta. Esta estrategia consigue reducir la dependencia del vehículo privado, contribuyendo también a la reducción de la contaminación dentro de la ciudad. En muchos casos se podría complementar con la promoción de vehículos pequeños como las motocicletas.
Los ciudadanos cogemos el coche privado porque tenemos que trasladarnos a un lugar alejado al que no podemos acceder de otra forma más eficiente, y cuando lo hacemos todos a la vez, las vías de acceso se congestionan. Pues una forma de evitar esto es promoviendo la vida urbana a escala humana, es decir, trabajar, compartir y disfrutar de tu ocio en áreas de escala reducida. Y para ello se deben promover políticas urbanas que busquen la diversidad del uso de la ciudad y que premien que los lugares de trabajo se encuentren cerca de la vivienda.

Crear mas vias, autopista que no tengan acceso el uso de vehiculos de carga.

Usar vehiculo compartido como uber , lift .

The benefits of this include:

- Add a timer screen to all traffic signals (like the ones used for pedestrian cross walks) on major intersections to allow drivers to calculate brake distance therefore minimizing red light accidents. 

- implement a legal speed limit max/min for each lane on  i -95  ,making the left lanes highest velocity and the right lanes the lowest velocity, to be highly enforced by law officials with strict fines if not abided. This will allow commuters to drive in lanes that match their desired speed without  having to interrupt the flow of the expressway creating uniformity and minimizing not only unnecessary traffic, but accidents as well. The speed limit min should be painted on each lane with reflectors at every mile marker. 

- routine traffic stops conducted by law enforcement officials should not obstruct moving lanes. Frequently I experience traffic jams simply because law enforcement has stopped someone in the middle of a busy street blocking lanes just to issue a traffic ticket.  The vehicles should always be pulled over to the curb or nearest parking lot anywhere that does not obstruct the flow of traffic. Not only to better the flow of traffic but also, for the safety of law enforcement officials.","69","4","1","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-14 04:28:54",,"2018-06-14 04:28:54","2018-06-14 12:23:06","2018-06-14 12:16:50",,,,"2018-06-14 04:28:54","2018-07-06 17:52:11","2018-06-14 12:16:50",,,"4","1","0","0","0","4","1","0","0","0","2018-06-14 12:23:06","2018-06-14 12:16:50",,,"2018-07-06 17:52:11","2018-06-14 12:16:50",,,"4","1","0","0","0"

Let's say that the ratio will change to a single lane, which will be more expensive than all others but 2-3 lanes of high occupancy vehicles only for a reduced priced tolls. By using an app to ease the pickup of extra passengers a driver can now avoid heavy tolls, share the cost of his/her gas expenses and use more lanes. All of that is right for when using the highway, but what if a mom needs to pick up her kid from school - the same concept will allow various levels of app usage, to allow moms, workers, travelers, etc. to collaborate with shared rides all over town. The last aspect is encouraging businesses to work remotely by developing shipment - Amazon found great ways of helping people get goods and services by staying at home - if the long line of 100+ people per hour on the line to order their Burrito at Chipotle could stay at home knowing one of the drones or self driven distribution robots will deliver the freshness, that by itself is 100 less vehicles on the roads.

Thoughts ranging from A-Z
Problems stacked higher than an overpath
Their eyes are mapped with red from the tired
Perhaps from doing a double shift
Gears can change within the speed of a shooting star
Road rage, emotions are triggered
One may carry a glock or carry bat
Converting anger into the wrong field
Could have converted the anger into a contribution to the City of Tomorrow Challenge
At least a phone married to the ear of the driver is better
A simple button or touch causes the annulment, resulting in refocusing
Paying attention as you enter the intersection as it has become the new four way stop
For your daily red light runner
In a hurry to get to the other side
Yet, you both meet up at the same light up ahead
Driver to your left waters her shoulders undeniably with bad news
Toddlers in the back seat to your right are hopping around as if the seats are their lily pads
Tailgator from a couple blocks back plays his horn
You wait a couple of seconds before you dance across
You know the slow dancing saved you from an accident before
Sometimes it could be worse on the highway
Watch as some believe its a personal runway
Switching lanes like switching hips
Some may drive fast, and they are furious
Like they are auditioning for  Nascarland but this is reality
It shouldn't have to smack you like flying debris

The hard part about this is roads with just two lanes, & the whole system. I believe that two lane roads wont be important over all, but idve to look at all the roads. Now, for reform of the whole system, you need consistent service, wherein the buses work like a metro--same hours for all & one route per road. Now, what we have is two routes on the same road or more routes & that is unhelpful, &, also, others without weekend service. In other words, the bus system needs to run like a metro system, with complete regularity, as if each road was a railway. Of course, we need better looking, better smelling buses, which we can get thru automatic air fresheners & more long buses like the new hybrids, wherein even more people. In fact, the metro is completely unnecessary. Now, it is true that at first cars may crash with buses, like what we see with the new Brightline trains, & the often deaths, but in the long term, less people will drive, crash, get fat, etc. Buses can be incredibly attractive, but, i repeat, bus-only lanes with a regularized route-per-road system alone achieves that. It is also important to market transit, & it makes me proud that it is already often done by the County, but we can do it more, especially when we have so much on the line, as climate change worsens & speeds. People like you, Ford, should also encourage purchase of light, compact cars, not behemoth metal boxes, great threats to public & pedestrian & biker's safety.

After pondering, and observing patterns for years, I've come to notice that the majority of the congestion is made up of parents delivering or picking up their children from schools. Ever wonder why traffic is much lighter during summer break? Example, It takes me 2hrs and 20mins to reach coconut grove from my home on the border of the Redlands. During summer months when school is not in session, it takes me half that time. Therefore, i propose that strategically placed central school pick up hubs are built throughout dade county to facilitate a much easier and more streamlined/efficient process for delivery and drop off of school kids to their parents. Additionally, dedicated bus lanes and public transport only lanes should be dedicated to ensure that these new forms of transport depart and arrives on time. Perhaps train or tram systems to deliver kids to their appropriate schools would also suffice. The parents reach those drop off/pick up hub points and they will be on their way stress free to work or back home without worry, Granted, this may not be a fix all, but its certainly a larges step toward the relief and I gaurentee will cut traffic commuting times in half for all residents.

The Metro Line ends in Dadeland when there is plenty of space to create a metro line above the bus lanes all the way until at least Southland Mall. I think this will decrease the traffic by a lot.

Finally, we have to consider building a superhighway thru a portion of the eastern edge of the Everglades. The highway needs to have a minimum of 12 lanes to include a high speed rail corridor. A minimum of 5 planned stopped should be build along the corridor with major feeder passageways that connect to I-95. Busways and railways could feed back into the city area’s. 95% of the South Florida traffic moving in the flow of rush hour only has 1-2 options to travel and this current setup is getting worse by the day.

Over there, have busses bring them to downtown Miami, where their will be smaller vehicles drop them off at their exact locations.

The busses should have access to HOV Lanes on the highways to incourage commuters to use the system, and to make the commute faster for everyone. 

This way the expressways/ highways will have less regular car traffic and more busses and the local traffic downtown will have less busses, and also not really any increase in cars because this would all be based on a ride sharing platform. 

So I'm bullet points to simplify the process: 

- 7:00-7:05 get picked up, dropped off by 7:15 at a local bus pickup (an accessible intersection near a highway)
- 7:20 bus leaves to downtown.
-7:25-40 (dependent on distance in Miami) dropped off at car park off the highway where a vehicle is waiting to take you to your place of work. 
-7:30-7:55 dropped off at the corner or at the entrance to work.

Advantages to this plan: 
1 - less people using personal vehicles to get to work. 
2 - cheaper than Uber pool. 
3 - less walking than busses.
4 - less busses in the small roads downtown, which make wide turns and in general hold up traffic downtown.","54","1","2","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-14 15:55:08",,"2018-06-14 15:55:09","2018-06-23 20:56:06","2018-06-23 20:58:07",,,,"2018-06-14 15:55:08","2018-06-23 20:56:06","2018-06-25 21:15:14",,,"1","2","0","0","0","1","2","0","0","0","2018-06-23 20:56:06","2018-06-23 20:58:07",,,"2018-06-23 20:56:06","2018-06-25 21:15:14",,,"1","2","0","0","0"

An optimal solution is to form a county-wide plan that helps interconnect the city through metro-rail expansion, municipality coordination with local trolleys, and  better bus routine formations. 

 Most metro rail users take it because they have no other form of transportation, very few people  used the metro because of convenience .  To have a reasonable amount of the population to consider using the metro, we must have a large expansion reach most if not all communities. Moving around has to be practical for people to give up their cars. We need people from Miami Gardens using the metro as frequently as people in Brownsville or Brickell.

Furthermore, in areas where the metro cannot reach, we must have buses that can take you to the metro and to other areas. Miami buses are slow, late, and infrequent. Local trolleys have helped but not resolved the problem. Increasing interconnections between trolleys while expanding funding for county-wide busing can eliminate cars on the road in Miami.","44","1","1","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-14 16:22:48",,"2018-06-14 16:22:48","2018-07-06 17:54:40","2018-06-14 18:01:35",,,,"2018-06-14 16:22:48","2018-07-06 17:54:40","2018-06-14 18:01:35",,,"1","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","2018-07-06 17:54:40","2018-06-14 18:01:35",,,"2018-07-06 17:54:40","2018-06-14 18:01:35",,,"1","1","0","0","0"

One issue i have noticed is the rush hour, a few years back there was only one time for rush hour which started at 5 pm and lasted about an hour and a half to two hours. Now there's rush hour starting at about 4:30 pm and another wave of traffic that starts at 6 pm and can last all the way up until 8 pm depending on what area in Miami.  In my opinion a lot of people that don't know how to drive are given drivers licenses so one solution can be, being more strict on the driving test. Another solution can be  businesses changing there hours of operation depending on there location so like that instead of multiple businesses closing at 5 Pm which sends out thousands of people at once causing traffic they change those hours by one to two hours which would definitely be a sacrifice many employees would be willing to endure if it means arriving home sooner.  We can also lower rates for metro rails and public buses from little to no cost if it means encouraging people to use a service that's more beneficial to their pockets . Lastly, we should be mindful of the intersections that have more traffic and allow the lights to last a few moments longer to keep a steady flow of traffic.","91","1","3","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-14 16:23:40",,"2018-06-14 16:23:40","2018-06-16 12:05:43","2018-06-14 17:49:25",,,,"2018-06-14 16:23:40","2018-06-16 12:05:43","2018-06-14 18:33:18",,,"1","3","0","0","0","1","3","0","0","0","2018-06-16 12:05:43","2018-06-14 17:49:25",,,"2018-06-16 12:05:43","2018-06-14 18:33:18",,,"1","3","0","0","0"

While on the bus I am given the strange opportunity to peer in to driver's cabin beside the buses, and most of the time what I have seen are older drivers (70s+) driving in the far left lanes going about 10mph under the speed limit, which is causing traffic and leading others to weave in and out of traffic to get around them. Also seen are adult drivers on their cell phones. So not only do teens need driver safe technology, but so do these adults who are causing more and more accidents daily compared to their younger counterparts. Therefore not only do we need a new traffic pattern but we need to get those off the road that are causing the problems, including those without insurance, which needs to be enforced and regulated. You shouldn't be able to have a car and a drivers license if you have no car/drivers insurance, these people are clogging the road ways and making a daily danger for those of us on the roads following the rules. A third option are more carpool offers, so larger companies should enforce these for an emissions subsidy and help get their employees to work safely while also helping the environment.","51","0","1","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-14 17:29:51",,"2018-06-14 17:29:51",,"2018-06-14 17:43:10",,,,"2018-06-14 17:29:51",,"2018-06-14 17:43:10",,,"0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0",,"2018-06-14 17:43:10",,,,"2018-06-14 17:43:10",,,"0","1","0","0","0"

If we increase RIDE ASSISTANCE (V#3) we will have a significant change of vehicles, decreasing  V#2, on the streets but this turns better if we increase V#1 in the ride ""home-work and return"" we will have the impact directly on the traffic rush hour. 
How?
Let's say our government spent billions in new and the maintenance of roads, and highways. 
And this is not eco-friendly. 
This is our current equation:
More people = more vehicles = more highways = less green = less oxygen = more accidents = more traffic = more money needed ... and again ...and again ...and again
But what will happen if we converge onto this dilemma each employer, each small, medium or transnational business.  What will happen if we offer a tax exemption, or some kind of tax credit or even better some financial assistance for those who are willing to create a plan for their employees to provide ride assistance between each other using an application in our smartphones able to capture biometrics, able to monitor and verified GPS and able the application to report ride assistance offered how many miles
This employee deserves a reward thru the employer because is part of another equation, this employee saves money, saves traffic, saves green and saves people at the end.","107","5","4","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-14 18:01:01",,"2018-06-14 18:01:01","2018-06-14 18:41:48","2018-06-14 22:17:57",,,,"2018-06-14 18:01:01","2018-07-01 02:37:02","2018-07-01 02:37:31",,,"5","3","0","0","0","5","4","0","0","0","2018-06-14 18:41:48","2018-06-14 22:17:57",,,"2018-07-01 02:37:02","2018-07-01 02:37:31",,,"5","3","0","0","0"

Having a huge timer on the boom barrier, letting the driver know this exits is close for 15-20 mins, they can wait or go more north via alternative routes. Dispersing the traffic between roads, allows a equalizing of cars on I-95.  What made me think of this, is when waiting in line for an attraction or restaurant. They control how much comes, but having intervals. People can stay or find an alternative when waiting, same can be applied for coming on the highway during traffic. Maybe also, create an app letting drivers know which entrance is close and show the countdown timer for each one, showing when it will open again.

I have seen plenty of times where an ambulance has to go through rush hour traffic to get to their destination and it not only creates more traffic but it delays them as well. When rush hour traffic is at its max, there's 3-4 lanes on any street, and every car is at a stop, i've seen emergency vehicles trying to push through with very little progress. The cars then try to move to the side or to the other lane which then causes a ripple effect of more traffic. Emergency vehicles should have their own lanes to drive on, not just on the highway, but on the local roads to. Another big contributor to traffic is the blocking of intersections. Sometimes drivers don't realize that by blocking an intersection, when the light changes and they are stuck in the middle, the cars on the other side are now stuck as well. Thus, creating gridlock for everyone around them. The signs on the intersection lights saying its a $500 fine are small & most people probably don't see them. Overall, more access to public transportation and other small changes should help with the overall congestion.","56","1","1","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-14 19:56:08",,"2018-06-14 19:56:08","2018-06-16 17:52:50","2018-06-16 17:56:27",,,,"2018-06-14 19:56:08","2018-06-16 17:52:50","2018-06-16 17:56:27",,,"1","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","2018-06-16 17:52:50","2018-06-16 17:56:27",,,"2018-06-16 17:52:50","2018-06-16 17:56:27",,,"1","1","0","0","0"

In Miami-Dade County, if you have to use your vehicle to get to transit you will not get out of your vehicle to utilize any other means of transportation.  I say this because in using technology and the services of both bike, car and other share programs riders like myself could be incentivized to use transit more often.  I mention this because I spend more thinking about how I am going to make it from the station to my house than I do on any other activity in my daily commute.  If we had a technology platform that could both plan my trips daily and charge me for the trip similar to UBER/LYFT, I think you would get more riders like me who are thinking of dropping one of their vehicles if such a platform to execute our commutes and other transportation activities were in place.  Moreover, if the government provided some incentive for those users who live within a mile of a transit station to utilize this service, I believe ridership would escalate in Miami-Dade.

As Miami is well aware, you can’t keep building roads and widening travel lanes, hence the quirky video from Portland on the concept of induced demand. When you build for cars you get cars.  Then space even for buses or transit becomes a contested issue. Parking and free parking continues supporting this. 

With safe cycling infrastructure making cycling convenient and accessible, it should be able to alleviate Miami’s congestion by allowing an alternative to driving to multimodal hubs. In Amsterdam at any given moment 200 trains pass through the city. The stations create catchment areas that overlap and create a new trend of providing route choice for people accessing them by bicycle. The bicycle provides an easy mobility option to the bus/train station that moves more people efficiently.

“The bicycle is traditionally mainly used as an access mode and mainly in conjunction with trains. Often, it is stated that the bike extends the catchment-area of public transport or multi-modal nodes, but its counterpart is true as well; multi-modal travel improves the business case for the bicycle.” http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856416000240

A portion of the traffic does occur from accidents but a majority of the traffic is caused by the lack of lanes for the extended population to travel on at peak times. Exit lanes are minimum and cause back ups and delays for miles back because of the citizens fighting to get off the highway and the use of tolls have caused many people to sit in traffic for hours at a time before getting home while others pay $10 dollars to get a few hundred feet ahead of others (I95). What can be done is to get rid of all tolls and expand the exit lanes and make dedicated lanes of exit for each individual exit. expanding the exit lanes and making dedicated lanes for each exit will nullify the traffic that build up from people exiting and closing tolls all a steady stream of traffic to move.

Now how does this help is as follows:
the elderly are still on the road some who driving skills are excellent but with age we do lose our reflexes and time in reacting. So they past the driving test they can stay on the road. Should they not give them a window to return and attempt again (second failure) they must wait 6 months or whatever to attempt again. many have observed some elderly individuals who you question in your mind “should they still be driving?”. Now it may sound like a penalty but there are ways to get around still being elderly some have STS transporting or even Uber funds so they do not lose their independence.
The international drivers are another concern, they think they still drive in their origin country. They don’t obey laws (ex: yields/ do not block intersections) We can weed out the weaker of the drivers by having their skills tested.
Young drivers  get nervous in driving. Driving test would give them reassurance and training to become safer drivers.

Cars have automatic brakes now too. If someone in front of them stops the car can pick up the sudden change in speed of the car in front and come to a halt without having the people crash. Handsfree option for example, android connect, or apple car connect for the phones so drivers will keep there eyes on the road and be less distracted by the phone.

Buses need to all be electric. Buses need to be frequent and predictable. Phone apps and/or displays at stops need to communicate schedules and any changes. Express buses, light rail, and heavy rail lines need to be extended to cover densely populated areas with N/S, E/W routes feeding from less dense to more dense areas with personal larger vehicle parking in the less dense areas and bicycle parking in the more dense area stations. 

Put some $$ into marketing, so people know how and why to use transit. Build elevated lines through busy neighborhoods like Calle 8 or Flagler or Coral Way or Biscyane Blvd.

For instance:   On Mondays, cars with license plates ending in number 2 and 3 can circulate on that day from 6 am to 8 pm.  On Tuesdays, cars with license plates ending in numbers 4 and 5 can circulate on that day from 6 am to 8 pm.  Wednesday to Friday would run in a similar fashion.  For those that cannot drive the cars, they could do ""carpools"" for go to  work.  Businesses could  provide a form of flexible spending account that would reimburse employees when they leave their car at home,  and either carpool or go to work with some other type of transportation like Lyft/Uber.  Instead, the flexible spending could be used for public transportation.  For those that disobey the law,  the revenue to support the administration of the program,  would come from traffic tickets.

But because there are only 2 main highways leading to it, most of the time, that hwy traffic is all ending to the airport exit. Having MORE roadways in, would help reduce some early morning and mid afternoon headaches for the locals. Which leads to my second note, the people. We can never do anything about being overly populated bc that's why they keep building and building BUT it will be helpful to provide the residents and locals with exclusive transportation during festivals and exhibits that sometimes last up to a week. Money needs to come in but by having more population in certain weeks of the year, it creates more jam, so having exclusive transportation that can lead to major neighborhoods or something like that is helpful than more rentals on the street. Lastly, changing the flow of traffic. Businesses can start employees a little earlier or later depending on commute...","61","1","1","0","0","0","1","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-15 04:26:57",,"2018-06-15 04:26:57","2018-06-15 09:36:38","2018-06-16 17:24:28",,"2018-06-15 04:58:04",,"2018-06-15 04:26:57","2018-06-15 09:36:38","2018-06-16 17:24:28",,"2018-06-15 04:58:04","1","1","0","0","1","1","1","0","0","1","2018-06-15 09:36:38","2018-06-16 17:24:28",,"2018-06-15 04:58:04","2018-06-15 09:36:38","2018-06-16 17:24:28",,"2018-06-15 04:58:04","1","1","0","0","1"

Therefore you have to drive slow to find a semi good spot where you won't get your car broken into but also, not towed either because it's a residential area. By creating more parking lots up, you would reduce some of that traffic of the ""bad drivers"" that are probably just driving slow because you're looking for parking. With the airport suggestion, is making more mini exits before and after that surrounds the airport just specifically for the airport, therefore dividing the commuting to work and school people with the I'm leaving to the airport and the I'm dropping off my friend at the airport people that can help loosen congestion at those peak times. Lastly, help employers by having scheduled days where it can create a pattern for people who work down south but live a little north or vice versa in miami-dade commute less cringy.

Requirements:
1.	User participation to exceed currently set threshold for number of road occupants needed to trigger system activation 
2.	Sharing Location/Destination via SMS or GPS smartphone application (plug-in) to local transportation jurisdiction
3.	Programmable traffic control system for the local transportation jurisdiction

Very similar to automated elevator systems the users enter their location/destination which shares this data with local traffic control systems.  Thereafter, it hourly analyzes the volume, destinations and routes to determine who takes what path while altering the traffic control system operations.

Basically, distribute the traffic load across all the roadways instead of just the main thruways.  So yes, some paths might “seem” longer however when you minus the delay would have spent in traffic equal in travel time to respective destinations.  I believe current GPS applications attempt this on a rudimentary scale whereby people many times ignore the recommendations and go the route familiar with.  This is where you take road condition feedback to reroute willing participants out of those people paths.

The local DOT knows every light with its timing, stop sign, lane width and zoning class.  This information is what the algorithm will use to determine the routes for users at any given hour post system trigger.  Plus will have historical data built on actual usage to be used in future planning.","110","3","4","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-15 16:25:39",,"2018-06-15 16:25:39","2018-06-20 16:26:24","2018-06-16 16:15:43",,,,"2018-06-15 16:25:39","2018-06-28 20:10:49","2018-06-22 21:20:12",,,"3","2","0","0","0","3","4","0","0","0","2018-06-20 16:26:24","2018-06-16 16:15:43",,,"2018-06-28 20:10:49","2018-06-22 21:20:12",,,"3","2","0","0","0"

Removing vehicles from our roadways that are not properly insured could potentially cut congestion by 20-30%. Simple fact, if you don't have insurance you should not be on the road.

There is nothing more frustrating than cars weaving in and out of traffic, this is also a major accident cause. If we educate drivers by ticketing them for passing on right, and post more signs that state the LAW FOR SLOWER TRAFFIC TO KEEP RIGHT, we  could have a better traffic flow.

I can't tell you how many times I drive down a road to stop at a red light and once the light turns green the next light several blocks away turns red, again and again. If these traffic lights would be regulated to traffic flow, we would be headed in the right direction for alleviating our traffic nightmares.

Drivers in Miami need to be re-educated. Sure we could add more mass transit, but there will still be drivers on the road regardless.

It is a shame that people have to have ""uninsured motorist"" policy on their insurance. Countless accidents caused by uninsured motorists and drivers leaving the scene. We should not have to pay extra for the few that take advantage of the system.

There is a shopping center near this bus stop but I am not able to park my vehicle on this private businesses lot for these purposes other than to shop at their store. This is what stops most people from taking public transportation. Why would I take the bus if it is 1.) going to take longer for me to get to/from work 2.) I am going to be sweaty by the time I get to my destination. 3.) it is the same amount of cost if not more than driving. If there was parking at main intersection bus stops this would possibly be a reliever of some congestion. Case in point: I thought I would at least take the metromover from college north station to the school district stop every day which would relieve some congestion in dwntwn and make my commute less. There is no parking at the school district station for metromover riders. Thus you must pay a private lot and I am getting a better price at downtown than away 4rm it.SAD + little plannin","136","5","6","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-15 19:29:09",,"2018-06-15 19:29:10","2018-06-15 21:11:02","2018-06-16 15:45:42",,,,"2018-06-15 19:29:10","2018-07-06 17:46:52","2018-06-22 19:57:54",,,"5","4","0","0","0","5","6","0","0","0","2018-06-15 21:11:02","2018-06-16 15:45:42",,,"2018-07-06 17:46:52","2018-06-22 19:57:54",,,"5","4","0","0","0"

It has multiple stations that are located on strategic points that include: connecting the two main airports of the area, and the surrounding cities of the west like Doral, Hialeah, Pembroke pines and the beach strip cities. including Key Biscayne which is probably one of the worst affected with the traffic.
It will include a connection with I 75 that would require a big parking lot for people that comes from the west coast and wants to join the system at the Pembroke pines station and go anywhere from here without further congesting the city. 
it takes in to consideration the Florida's and Ronald Reagan turnpikes with a big station that would have a big parking lot for cars coming from this system and desire join the greater miami metro system.
A articulated bus system could be established from areas that would gather a lot of people, like shopping malls ( dolphin mall,  dadeland, bayside, stadiums, pembroke mall, downtowns, etc) in order to feed the stations with people and not with cars. 
I could draw more detailed ideas upon request.

Simple, yet needed features like that allow parents to help deter teens from the many distractions they may face while on the road unsupervised.

There’s too many crashes on the roads, and creates traffic as well; everyday when I drive, I always see another crash accident, wether it’s the weather or people driving crazy.  We should build more metro, more trains. I also believe peopl should drive more bicycles; nowadays no one gets to enjoy our nature; riding bikes would be a great way to save and improve traffic.  Build more sidewalks for pedestrians.  Also create more road signs with lights. Maybe some fun events like national car free day.

As such, there are very few commonly adhered to principle for drivers with each driver living by their own ""rules of the road"". Contrast this to driving in Germany on the Autobahn where everyone follows common practices.  Even though speeds are greater on the Autobahn, the difficulty in driving is significantly less and the safety improved. In SF, however, driving is chaotic and sometimes downright dangerous. Since few people follow the historical practice of ""move left to pass, move right when not passing"", traffic flow is significantly sub-optimal. Slow drivers can be found in all lanes, even the far left lanes. In fact, the new driving patterns in SF are quite the opposite. Those who speed the fastest are often found in the far right lanes weaving in and out of traffic because these lanes tend to be less densely used. Since traffic no longer flows in ordered ways, frequent choke points are created where multiple slow vehicles, across many lanes create chaotic and dangerous driving behind them.  Commercial truck are a big part of this problem and routinely occupy all but the left most lane. The real problem with SF traffic isn't that there isn't enough road highway capacity, it is that capacity is so poorly utilized. Successful solutions that address this problem via technology, media, and behavioral coaching (law enforcement) would likely increase road capacity by over 20% (guesstimate).","65","0","1","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-17 23:56:04",,"2018-06-17 23:56:04",,"2018-06-18 22:23:40",,,,"2018-06-17 23:56:04",,"2018-06-18 22:23:40",,,"0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0",,"2018-06-18 22:23:40",,,,"2018-06-18 22:23:40",,,"0","1","0","0","0"

Dade county traffic issues have increased dramatically in the past 20 years & peak hours seems to be disappearing daily due to the increase of constant cluster of vehicles 24-7
PLATE DATE can be the solution for traffic problems
1) An organized system where vehicle plates ending in a specific number cannot be on the road during ""rush hour or peak hours"" Mon - Fri (fewer vehicles on the road)
2) If a vehicle is caught during these hours, the owner would be penalized with a severe fine (extra income for the county and/or the city)
3) Only public transportation will be allowed (creates jobs/ increases economy)
4) Only vehicles with 3 passengers or more will be allowed on the road (pulling)
5) Once a month, a weekday will be assigned to this system where from 7am to 7pm no vehicles will be allowed on the road except public transportation & vehicles with 3 passengers o more (positive environmental impact)
6) PLATE DATE costs NOTHING
Obviously, other solutions can be more bridges, more public transportation as monorails, trolleys, cable cars and such that will help prevent the traffic jams in Dade County but that would be more expenses that could unbalance budgets and reserves. PLATE DATE may or not eradicate the problem but it will definitely ease the situation. Not only is cost effective but it is green oriented.

It's technically like a walkway dedicated to barefooting, which is something that can be innovated for better health with its 50+ health benefits: https://prezi.com/kvujujmnxnr1/50-great-reasons-to-kick-off-your-shoes/

It can bring up some assumptions, but it is actually a healthy innovation once you get a better understanding of barefooting like in the Prezi link I left above for you to check if you haven't done so already. I even found out that they are common to be found in some European countries since they even have some public barefooting parks to people to explore and innovate with nature: www.barfusspark.info/en/park.htm

So, whether as a new attraction at a science museum (what I personally would like to see) or an addition (or replacement) at parks as the new sidewalk pathways, or even as something anyone can create in their backyard or as their new walkway to the front of their house, wouldn't it just be more innovative or at least creative to have something more than just regular slaps of concrete everywhere?

Besides, for those who love going/being barefoot, some of the floorings you can choose for the path, like synthetic grass or wood or even hay, are technically not going to really become hotter when in hot weather unlike cemented concrete in the summer time.","257","3","17","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-19 02:35:40",,"2018-06-19 02:35:40","2018-06-19 15:47:54","2018-06-19 16:08:30",,,,"2018-06-19 02:35:40","2018-07-06 18:11:29","2018-07-25 18:00:10",,,"3","5","0","0","0","3","17","0","0","0","2018-06-19 15:47:54","2018-06-19 16:08:30",,,"2018-07-06 18:11:29","2018-07-25 18:00:10",,,"3","5","0","0","0"

My vision may sound far fetched, however it is not achievable. Major companies should provide a hired car service for their employee's. It would be easier for workers to meet at a central location and ride a chartered bus into town. For example, when I lived in Indiana and worked in Chicago, many companies would pitch in for a charter bus to pick people up in Indiana and bring them into downtown Chicago at a central location where we could either walk or take the subway. Another thing is providing the car sharing service similar to the one in Seattle, where people drive free floating cars provided by a free floating car sharing service. They designate a certain area right outside of the downtown area where members can request a ride(similar to UBER) but unique in it's own way. A driver will pick up several members from the area and drive them into downtown. This prevents the overcrowding of vehicles, and the parking situation. Another idea is to only allow people to drive their cars into Miami on nights and weekends, instead of during the work week's business hours. People coming from any place north of Miami should take a different form of transportation when commuting in for work. As far as the whole out of space idea. It would be a big vessel that can hold alot of people, run frequently at high speed ,be the width of 2-3 lanes, self driving, and the ability to lift up over traffic with hydraulics.","57","1","1","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-19 16:10:38",,"2018-06-19 16:10:38","2018-06-20 16:28:08","2018-06-19 17:33:03",,,,"2018-06-19 16:10:38","2018-06-20 16:28:08","2018-06-19 17:33:03",,,"1","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","2018-06-20 16:28:08","2018-06-19 17:33:03",,,"2018-06-20 16:28:08","2018-06-19 17:33:03",,,"1","1","0","0","0"

(1) There are many one-way streets to help the flow of traffic.
(2) On 1st Ave N and 1st Ave S there are one-way designated bike lanes separate from traffic lanes and pedestrian side walks (see attached image)
(3) The car lanes, bike lanes, and sidewalks are all divided by medians and foliage.
(4) There is a new elevated toll gateway expressway being constructed connecting Tampa and Saint Petersburg. In my opinion it is genius, especially if they construct it in a way that they are able to add levels in the future. My proposal: the higher the level, the more you pay, the less traffic there is. The lower the level, the less you pay, the more traffic there is. If you did this over all major highways and corridors, you would not only solve the traffic problems in Miami, but you would reduce the ground floor to local traffic.

1. Miami Dade County Traffic signals are frequently mis-timed, and poorly maintained, and systems do not have generator back up connections for hurricane or power failures, despite being permitted by FDOT (Design Standard index 17841). I will be happy to assist with reviews, and redesigning of roads with traffic circles that eliminate traffic lights that require timed delays before changing, and that also slow traffic that must restart when stopped.
2. Construction MOT' plans, and utility service contractors frequently work during peak traffic periods and further clog traffic, and disrupt efficient flow of traffic. Proper planning and night time work periods will reduce disruptions.
4. Elevate rail systems in urban environment, intersection closures frequently disrupt traffic up to 18 times per day.
5. Create delivery zones for all commercial areas as part of zoning, so trucks get out of roadways when making deliveries.
6. Create road ranger program for cities to quickly and efficiently remove disabled vehicles from roads, or re-route with cones as needed, easily added to any city's traffic unit if vehicle and equipment grants provided.
7. Directional traffic flow patterns which expand and contract as needs change, more out flow from city during afternoon rush hour, and more inbound during morning rush hour.
8. Count down timers on top of the traffic signals, prepare drivers to go faster.
9.

Some cities in the US already have deployed roundabouts and had great success with them. They are a cheap and great solution for the crazy amount of cross-traffic in Miami.  The real chalenge will be educating the uneducated drivers in Florida. People who don't sign to change lanes or cross several lanes at once. In the beginning, the roundabouts need to be well signed and with traffic officers along them to keep traffic flowing and educating people.
Another measure is the U-turn lanes instead of crossing traffic.

However, the same cannot be said about its traffic system. A first step into solving this issue is citizen awareness, commonly done via educational campaigns, with the goal of unclogging highways that are today, overcapacity. A second step, a bit more radical, would be to establish a criterion for the use of vehicles. Say, for example, that vehicles whose plates end in even or odd numbers would have designated days to circulate on the streets. Those who need to use their vehicle outside these criteria could do so but would be subject to the payment of extra traffic tax. The third, and final step, would be to prioritize public transportation. This would reduce all existing express lanes to only one corridor, leaving the others exclusively for the use of public transportation. If these measures were to be applied together, the message transmitted to society would be that individual transportation cannot overlap with collective. We would have more buses, operating at a faster and more efficient rate, that would enjoy the benefits of navigating through exclusive corridors. Consequently, these buses would attract more and more commuters.","64","0","1","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-24 21:36:23",,"2018-06-24 21:36:23",,"2018-06-27 01:36:43",,,,"2018-06-24 21:36:23",,"2018-06-27 01:36:43",,,"0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0",,"2018-06-27 01:36:43",,,,"2018-06-27 01:36:43",,,"0","1","0","0","0"

While natural market forces keep Miami growing, displacing many working class residents westward, we must prepare to adequately  service their commute eastward while not adding more financial burdens on them nor traffic burdens on our already congested roads. I propose the County and the Municipalities do 4 things:
1. Add sensors to intersections similar to the ones that monitor infractions
This will make roads more fluid by calculating which roads are more in demand and responding in kind
2. One way roads
This will also increase fluidity by serving more lanes for one direction, there would be less turns and wait times
3. Public Transportation, specifically Dedicated Buses and Bus Lanes
We need Buses dedicated to traveling long distances from say Kendall to Government Center with little stops. Also from certain times of the day, say 7-9am and 4-7pm, certain lanes are reserved for buses
4. Remove onerous regulations like the ones the City of Miami has recently passed, limiting bike/scooter-sharing companies.

The move away from a disintegrated and personal view of travel must yield to an integrated and collective one.  By putting personal comforts aside, a clearer and more participatory drive to efficiency in travel will emerge.  For Miami-Dade the following must occur:
--continued expansion of the gratis trolley system across all neighborhoods as well as building and designing trolleys that are more energy efficient and cyber connected
--due to the expanse of neighborhoods across an infrastructure that killed train transport long ago, a bus network connected to a smart grid is necessary.  This will have to include an expansion of express buses as well as hubs that then further expand into specific neighborhoods with trolley service, tram, and local bus service all at low or no cost
--Subsidies for public transport will come from many sources: higher personal car license plates, city taxes, and toll rates
--Participation will increase exponentially when this service is free or nearly free; transfers last for 24 hours and/or return trip; weekly and monthly passes are deeply discounted and free to low income households; local stops are further apart with cyber connected grids to avoid unnecessary stops and to help riders plan their trips via touch screens at stops or via apps and 21hr service","90","1","4","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-07-01 16:46:38",,"2018-07-01 16:46:38","2018-07-03 16:47:32","2018-07-02 03:08:19",,,,"2018-07-01 16:46:38","2018-07-03 16:47:32","2018-07-05 17:57:08",,,"1","3","0","0","0","1","4","0","0","0","2018-07-03 16:47:32","2018-07-02 03:08:19",,,"2018-07-03 16:47:32","2018-07-05 17:57:08",,,"1","3","0","0","0"

I believe that more people would ride the bus if there were:  1) express routes that did not  make so many unnecessary stops; 2) more frequent buses, that ran every half hour instead of just once an hour; and 3) free or low-cost bus passes for everyone.  All of this could be paid for with the  1/2 penny sales tax we taxpayers have been paying since 2002.    I live near the Metrobus 56 bus route and have sometimes taken it to my job in Coral Gables.  I would like to take it more often, but the bus makes so many stops, it is actually quicker for me to drive (1 hour drive versus 1-1/2 hours on the bus).  The bus travels a direct route down Miller Road to the University Metrorail Station.  From there, it takes a circuitous route to Doctors Hospital and through some Coral Gables residential areas before finally getting back onto Ponce de Leon Boulevard and down Le Jeune Road to downtown Coral Gables.  This circuitous part of the route adds at least 20 minutes to the trip, and I have rarely seen anyone use those stops.   Why not have an Express bus, which removes that unnecessary part of the route?  Then it would make sense for me to take the bus -  I could get to work on time and would happily leave the driving to someone else.   I'd save a fortune on gas as well as wear-and-tear on my car.","42","1","2","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-07-06 16:37:18",,"2018-07-06 16:37:18","2018-07-06 17:44:10","2018-07-08 20:38:57",,,,"2018-07-06 16:37:18","2018-07-06 17:44:10","2018-07-09 16:15:19",,,"1","2","0","0","0","1","2","0","0","0","2018-07-06 17:44:10","2018-07-08 20:38:57",,,"2018-07-06 17:44:10","2018-07-09 16:15:19",,,"1","2","0","0","0"

A bike route provides to access downtown thru SW 1 St is an example of how a bad intervention with liable purpose could endanger mobility, it creates a chaos entering downtown from one of the most important communication roads and difficult the access to I 95. In a city with so many blockades it's difficult to create a fluid net for private or public transportation and by the way increase the costs by expending more time and fuel to get to the different areas.

This is exit is one of many locations where a long day at work, plus a good amount of time on I95 can turn into an even longer time in your car if you don’t get lucky enough to beat the drawbridge. What some may see as a minor disruption in other coastal cities can be the determining factor in your 30-minute commute turning into 45-minutes here in Downtown Miami/Brickell. A line of cars can usually be seen from the James L Knight center all the way to the well known large tropical green exit signs that read Biscayne Blvd exit 2A. What is supposed to be the last best mile of your journey home can turn into 20-minute bumper-to-bumper horn honking, lane merging horror film. For many it’s become an area on the interstate where you can rest your foot while driving, typically because your car can be placed into park while waiting.

And then back again 4:10pm-4:50 or 6-6:30

1. If I leave after 6:30, the US-1 and 88th intersection is blocked when the light changes
2. the lights on 88th from US-1 to the 826 are all green long enough that you can make it only if you speed
3. On the 826, everyone is doing 75 instead of 55 until we all hit traffic
4. 826/25 light is so long
#The return
5. I leave the office outside of the 4:15-5:45 because my 30 minute drive turns into 45m-70m 
6. Turning left from 79th to 25th and then 25th to 826, is the most frustrating part of my day, lots of people cross the double line to pass loads of people to get in the left most turning lane to then cut back in to the right most lane to get on the 826. Some of them blocking the 79/25 intersection in the process. 
7. Once on the 826 I cut over to the left lane to avoid the people who cut in last second after taking the exit to 836 as far as they can 
8. stop and go in traffic on the rest of the 826
9. This light has a sensor that seems to be too far forward because people will sit too far back and not trigger it leading to a long wait period

And after the FIU Bridge Collapse, it has come to our attention that we need to consider making FIU more transit and pedestrian accessible, while at the same time, relieving the area’s traffic problems

Since SW 8th Street is one of Miami’s busiest roads, why not build a Tamiami Trail Tunnel (between SW 107th Avenue and the Turnpike) to carry thru traffic and reduce the at-grade portion to four lanes (two each way). That way, cars won’t be weaving across four lanes of traffic, just to turn into FIU or onto SW 109th Avenue.

Above ground, why not supplement the envisioned bus station with a Metrorail station, to convince the city to extend Metrorail to FIU.

And last but not least, let’s rebuild the FIU Pedestrian Bridge (but higher and sturdier this time) as the centerpiece of the project. We owe it to the community to finish what we’ve started and bring people together.","45","1","2","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-07-07 02:13:48",,"2018-07-07 02:13:48","2018-07-07 21:42:10","2018-07-08 21:14:06",,,,"2018-07-07 02:13:48","2018-07-07 21:42:10","2018-07-10 17:39:08",,,"1","2","0","0","0","1","2","0","0","0","2018-07-07 21:42:10","2018-07-08 21:14:06",,,"2018-07-07 21:42:10","2018-07-10 17:39:08",,,"1","2","0","0","0"

This can include driving a vehicle and parking it at the station, having a friend or relative drop them off and pick them up, taking a cab or Uber/Lyft, or taking another bus to the station.

A better method would be to implement a short distance pick-up system using an app on a hand-held device to connect initially with a driver occupied vehicle, and when the technology is fully developed, with electric driverless vehicles that can take passengers from where they reside to the main transportation centers. The cost for this system can be in the form of a small add-on to the transit pass, the sale of advertising space on and in the vehicle to help offset costs, and the use of tax dollars to benefit the community. 

This would make access to metrorail and metrobus easier and more convenient, help increase ridership along the main lines, encourage less use of private vehicles particularly for commuting, reduce traffic congestion, save on the extra cost of getting to the main transit lines, and contribute to a cleaner environment.","36","1","2","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-07-08 05:02:47","2018-07-08 05:09:12","2018-07-08 05:12:13","2018-07-26 10:35:08","2018-07-08 18:16:30",,,"2018-07-08 05:09:12","2018-07-08 05:12:13","2018-07-26 10:35:08","2018-07-14 18:28:40",,,"1","2","0","0","0","1","2","0","0","0","2018-07-26 10:35:08","2018-07-08 18:16:30",,,"2018-07-26 10:35:08","2018-07-14 18:28:40",,,"1","2","0","0","0"

This flatness has allowed for the ingenious engineering of land, from canals to tame the Everglades, railway corridors which, either heavily used or abandoned, remain sacred space, to high tension power lines that elegantly traverse urban and wild tropical landscapes equally.
These ROW’s are also underutilized. What if these vital arteries were expanded to do more and give more to the people, and link us in new and interconnected ways?
There’s currently 65 mi. of canals, 30 mi. of FPL high tension elec. corridors, and 50 mi. of average speed railroad corridors, all with ample ROW width that could accommodate more uses. These corridors could provide new bike & walking trails, new parks, and an alternative transit system powered by locals.
Instead of scraping the original 300 metrorail cars being replaced this yr. we keep them all, train local residents how to retool them to run! Power them with solar power, and automated them to pick up people along these arteries, on demand through the power of an app, to take them as close as possible to their final destination, linking up with a last mile provider to reach where they want to go.
With trails that accommodate all pedestrian uses we could not only have new green spaces for bike trails & leisure but a new supportive transit infrastructure that can complement the existing system.","378","8","3","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-07-08 14:14:49","2018-07-09 03:58:57","2018-07-09 03:58:57","2018-07-09 04:31:55","2018-07-09 14:39:53",,,"2018-07-09 03:58:57","2018-07-09 03:58:57","2018-07-10 00:36:47","2018-07-11 08:32:05",,,"8","2","0","0","0","8","3","0","0","0","2018-07-09 04:31:55","2018-07-09 14:39:53",,,"2018-07-10 00:36:47","2018-07-11 08:32:05",,,"8","2","0","0","0"
