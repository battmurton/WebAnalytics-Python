While in Hazelwood I got a great Danish and made some friends,  so the trip an inconvenience was worth it","90","2","1","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-05 02:42:51","2018-06-05 02:44:37","2018-06-05 02:42:51","2018-06-05 08:46:43","2018-07-04 01:37:33",,,"2018-06-05 09:08:06","2018-06-05 02:42:51","2018-06-05 19:19:21","2018-07-04 01:37:33",,,"2","1","0","0","0","2","1","0","0","0","2018-06-05 08:46:43","2018-07-04 01:37:33",,,"2018-06-05 19:19:21","2018-07-04 01:37:33",,,"2","1","0","0","0"

However, this idea has been a topic of conversation of many people that I have known. By extending the light rail system into possible areas like Oakland, Shadyside, Lawrenceville, and East Liberty, to name a few, this would connect those businesses to the people from all around the city and the South Hills. These are growing neighborhoods with the some of the city's best universities and their graduates that invest themselves in the future of Pittsburgh. Better transportation to these neighborhoods will cut back on those short commutes of just a mile or two. I live in Oakland but drive to work in Lawrenceville, although this may only be a couple of miles. I have friends that chose to take jobs downtown but end up living in Mt. Lebanon. They want to utilize the T instead of living in the city and having to take a bus because buses tend to not always be reliable. Traffic from those living south of the city could be dramatically reduced if the T extended to more neighborhoods that included the other major employers like UPMC hospitals in Oakland or even Bakery Square in East Liberty. These neighborhoods are growing at a fast rate and they should be included when identifying new mobility solutions. I believe this partnership is a great opportunity to shed light on the future of Pittsburgh and bring about ideas for great change.","292","13","11","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-05 18:17:44","2018-06-05 18:46:06","2018-06-05 18:52:45","2018-06-05 19:19:09","2018-06-05 22:45:23",,,"2018-06-05 18:52:45","2018-06-05 18:52:45","2018-07-10 02:26:02","2018-07-12 20:25:25",,,"13","6","0","0","0","13","11","0","0","0","2018-06-05 19:19:09","2018-06-05 22:45:23",,,"2018-07-10 02:26:02","2018-07-12 20:25:25",,,"13","6","0","0","0"

These crowded and busy routes need to have bus lanes so that our city can move large numbers of people through small corridors quickly. The BRT is coming eventually to help with the Forbes/Fifth corridor (as seen in the attached pictures). The buses taking the West Busway and that go along Carson street are also heavily used but frequently stuck in traffic which causes buses to be much slower than they actually are. Prioritizing transit on our roads will allow our city to grow much larger than the capacity of our roads will allow than if we were to mostly using single occupancy vehicles.

We could easily demo the effects of a bus lane with a short term pilot. Here's an example of a pilot in Boston that was converted into a full time lane.

If there were designated T stops outside of the ""pain points"" for traffic in the city - on the North shore, in the South hills, before the PPG paints arena - where you could park your car for a minimal fee ($1/hr or flat rate $5 for the day) if you were taking public transportation (get a parking ticket stamped inside the bus/T in order to prove you were there)- that would allow more people to conveniently access the city's public transportation options without sacrificing the time it takes to find a cheap or free parking spot and walk into the city/to the bus or T stop, or the money it takes to park at a closer spot. It would mean that more people could take public transport to sporting events, freeing up the area around the event from the gnarly traffic often created. It would mean that buses would have to contend with less traffic on their routes, allowing them to run more efficiently and make their scheduled stops on time. Keeping rates low would attract more people to the lots. Crowd source to find where these lots are most needed.","2","0","0","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-05 21:24:29",,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0",,,,,,,,,"0","0","0","0","0"

I call this contribution ""Opportunity Lost"" because that was unfortunately what happened. My wife and I both looking to go to Pittsburgh for a couple of things: one of which was to see a good friend of ours, but the other, and even more important, was for a business opportunity that could have potentially earned us a great deal of money. Now, we don't live right in Pittsburgh, but we do reside in what is considered the Pittsburgh area. We live in Donegal, we are both totally blind, and there is almost no transportation that cang get us into Pittsburgh save for a cab that would cost almost $100.00 one-way. We live in a town that is just off of the main bus routes, so most forms of public transportation will have nothing to do with coming to pick us up, and this is making it hard for us. We are professional musicians, and I know we could pick up a lot of work in Pittsburgh. On this most recent time when we should have been there, we missed out on a great opportunity simply because we are blind and couldn't get any sort of transportation to get us in. If there could be some form of public transportation that would pick people up that are not on the main bus routes and get them into and out of Pittsburgh, that would be wonderful, and would make it so many more could more easily find gainful employment.","364","1","10","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-05 22:08:34",,"2018-06-05 22:08:34","2018-06-05 22:16:51","2018-06-05 23:01:12",,,,"2018-06-05 22:08:34","2018-06-05 22:16:51","2018-07-04 01:24:37",,,"1","5","0","0","0","1","10","0","0","0","2018-06-05 22:16:51","2018-06-05 23:01:12",,,"2018-06-05 22:16:51","2018-07-04 01:24:37",,,"1","5","0","0","0"

As these areas developed over time - it has increased highway congestion for the city. Pittsburgh is one of the very few cities in the United States that has the opportunity of a lifetime to be able to provide a light rail solution at a nominal capital expense in comparative to typical light rail infrastructure costs. If Pittsburgh is able to collaborate with the three municipalities to invest, and acquire the sitting industrial rail from current private industry owners, the city has an opportunity to renovate the track without having to flatten mountains, or tunnel underneath them as it’s already completed. This could then be tied to the, ""T"" offering a rapid infrastructure expansion w/fiscally sound investment.

All that is needed is acquisition with track revitalization an station builds. If Pittsburgh was able to create collaboration with the municipalities seize the industrial track rights, and invest in the revamp of the rail - it could alleviate massive amount of congestion off the major highways and offer people a cheap, envirommentally friendly solution to get to work. 

Purchase the rights, update the track, build the stations and within 5 years you have a fully operating light rail system that enhances Pittsburgh’s mobility, increases revenues, and drives out environmental impacts.","1583","19","26","0","0","0","1","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-06 00:52:45","2018-06-06 00:54:31","2018-06-06 00:52:45","2018-06-06 13:10:31","2018-06-06 13:14:28",,"2018-06-22 13:53:00","2018-06-06 23:16:26","2018-06-06 00:52:45","2018-07-01 17:44:39","2018-07-15 23:23:13",,"2018-06-22 13:53:00","19","9","0","0","1","19","26","0","0","1","2018-06-06 13:10:31","2018-06-06 13:14:28",,"2018-06-22 13:53:00","2018-07-01 17:44:39","2018-07-15 23:23:13",,"2018-06-22 13:53:00","19","9","0","0","1"

When I was in Europe (Brno, Czech Republic) for 6 months both studying and working I took the metro everywhere I went. It was the best way of transportation and there were far less cars on the street at Brno then there are in Pittsburgh. They are very similar cities too due to the steel mill history and the culture of people. Every major city in the USA or Europe has a get T, Metro, or Subway system and personally I believe that the lack of it in Pittsburgh is what is holding the city back from being one of the top places in the USA. It will be more easy for tourist to get around, workers to get to work, and friends to be able to visit one another. Lastly, it will help inspire people to walk more because if you get off at a stop that is 3 blocks away from your destination it will help create good habits in people. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE help bring more T stops to Pittsburgh.

Consider a suburban florist who routinely makes several deliveries each day from Robinson to Downtown. That delivery vehicle (assuming a small SUV) likely has several empty passenger seats, which could be occupied by residents along the route who have no reasonable access to transit otherwise. 

Upsides for businesses are numerous, albeit minor:
- Decreases delivery costs
- Allows for expansion of delivery area
- Creates opportunity to find shipping efficiencies with other businesses
- Further cements business as a pillar of the community

For residents, the benefit is much greater:
- Unlocks an already-operational transit grid at zero cost to taxpayers
- Drastically decreases transit costs, as delivery vehicles are already dead-heading
- Helps to solve the transit design constraint of low-demand areas

The acquisition and optimization of local shipping data is something the Amazons (and Fords) of the world will soon be pursuing, so there is a broader upside here in creating a blueprint for other regions across the country.

- Acquisition/digitization of local business routes

# What exactly is Ground Truthed Data?
It is a combination of ride quality (from the phone's accelerometer) combined with an image of the actual bike lane. A reading is taken every 1 second and can provide FULL coverage of the quality of ALL bike lanes in the city, if so collected.

# Why use Ground Truth Data?
Data can be notoriously subjective and error-prone and lead to incorrect conclusions. This is particularly prevalent in local infrastructure decision making. This is why ARGO advocates the use of a Ground Truthed data to encourage transparency and  legibility to foster accurate decision making.

# How can SQUID Bike be implemented in Pittsburgh?
A small team of bike riders (from DOMI or the public) can mount smartphones on their bikes with the OSC app installed. As they ride, ground truth data is collected passively and can then be transmitted to OSC servers. All this data is open source and be made available to the public. Team ARGO can then deploy data infrastructure to aggregate the collected data into a customized dashboard.

# What is the key benefit of using SQUID Bike?
After collecting citywide ground truth data over 3 quarters, Pittsburgh will be able to see a deterioration trend for each and every bike lane. 
This allows Pittsburgh answer a key question: Which bike lanes are degrading quciker than others?","236","5","7","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-12 02:52:48","2018-06-12 03:00:05","2018-06-12 02:53:56","2018-06-12 09:30:36","2018-06-12 05:12:20",,,"2018-07-21 20:14:50","2018-06-12 03:05:29","2018-07-01 17:42:06","2018-07-04 01:04:01",,,"5","4","0","0","0","5","7","0","0","0","2018-06-12 09:30:36","2018-06-12 05:12:20",,,"2018-07-01 17:42:06","2018-07-04 01:04:01",,,"5","4","0","0","0"

I'm suggesting we repurpose the one most convenient to arts/sports/entertainment/recreation (Clemente Bridge) in a way that could boost public participation in all of those cultural components and promote walking/biking, without significantly affecting car traffic in the vicinity.

First, let me clarify the ""shuttle"": we're simply talking a bus or paratransit van running from one end of the bridge to the other, all day long (whenever there is a waiting passenger at either end.) Additional shuttles could bus people to these pickup points from the nearby (and often underused) parking lots.

While the bridge is short, and therefore not a huge transit boost to shuttle anyone who'd be walking across it otherwise, there could be value in assisting pedestrians to either side if we also build some useful facilities at the ends of the bridge to give them a break and a purpose. Some thoughts:

- Event sales booths, wherein one could peruse and purchase tickets for all events in the Downtown or North Shore districts from either side of the bridge, bypassing lines and door-to-door research
- Dining areas, where nearby restaurants can bike-deliver food on-demand. This would free up lunch options for employees who typically only eat what's on their side of the river
- Amazon lockers
- Street vendors/farmer's markets
- Scramble crosswalks at both ends of the bridge

A significant length of highway would be cost-prohibitive for COTC: the only reference point I have is a $2.75MM/5-year contract this startup has with Colorado DOT to build and manage a half-mile of road. But I believe the $100k project would cover a couple installs of single slabs (and related equipment), assuming piecemeal sales are something this startup is willing to do.

Let's assume it is feasible. What this really does is give the city and private partners a platform for developing solutions. Where I see the install(s) having value is either in an area of known congestion/complexity like the infamous on-ramp to the Squirrel Hill Tunnel, or an area of known danger in poor conditions, like pretty much any downhill Pittsburgh intersection.

In both cases, having a digital pulse on vehicle movement would assist first responders and police with traffic management. Much of the benefit beyond that is speculative, but again, what would make this viable is the potential it provides as a platform. If PGH is one of the early cities to adopt such a platform (even this small beta version), it should draw investment and innovation from early adopters in and outside the region.","112","3","2","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-16 02:43:21",,"2018-06-16 02:43:21","2018-06-16 14:04:35","2018-06-16 14:13:48",,,,"2018-06-16 02:43:21","2018-07-11 01:19:00","2018-07-04 00:56:04",,,"3","2","0","0","0","3","2","0","0","0","2018-06-16 14:04:35","2018-06-16 14:13:48",,,"2018-07-11 01:19:00","2018-07-04 00:56:04",,,"3","2","0","0","0"

In the Mon Valley, the trail system's northern shore fractures at Four Mile Run, where rail, the last big brownfield in the city, a large employer's park-and-ride-lot, a neighborhood and geographic constraints create a tangle of sidewalks, gravel bars, and dangerous traffic. Hazelwood is currently completely cut off. To its south, a potential trail to Braddock is hemmed in by rail crossings. The Glenwood Bridge, to the south shore, has stairs, but not ramps, to connect to the trail below.

On the Allegheny, the northern shore trail has much to expand north. The southern shore stops at 16th - not good enough.

Few hills up from the rivers to the East Liberty Valley, the flat ""plateau"" of Oakland and the East End, have protected & appropriate-grade bike paths. The river trails are great, but they are a *long way round* if one cannot get up into the city.

When a negative interaction occurs, most people will assume that it’s the fault of the robot, so it’s up to AV companies to take responsibility and create a clear course for improvement.

We should encourage more people to take the bus or T, and to walk or bike--and discourage people from driving--by making alternatives to driving easier and more appealing: FREE transit with higher frequency and later service; improved bus reliability with transit signal priority and bus lanes; better bus stops; a connected bike network and more bike share; and streets with sidewalks that are wide and enjoyable to walk along. 
To fund these, we should implement a congestion charge zone and price parking around the city using smart/dynamic pricing that adjusts according to supply and demand. Pricing should extend to on-street residential parking as well, expanding and enhancing the residential parking permit program. Loading/delivery zones can be installed to make it easy to drop people or goods off at home. Shared parking zones will allow available parking to be used more efficiently. Additional neighborhood garages could even be built where necessary.

At the same time, a huge portion of the daily commuters are going to the city come from the South Hills. For that reason, I think it would be in Pittsburgh's best interest to improve this connection and to therefore encourage people to bike downtown. Surely it is a complex problem to face as Mount Washington is a great hurdle as well as the inherent nature of the Liberty Tunnel and hills being unfriendly to cyclists. While there is the T- there are capacity restrictions at play and the twice-a-day cost associated with the T makes it a less than ideal option. 

Regardless, there are not even bike lanes on major arteries in the South Hills, making bike transportation even around the South Hills itself an unsafe headache. The roads are wider than the city and there's more opportunity to dedicate a safe space for cyclists. While the South Hills is traditionally relatively anti-bike, I think the time is ripe to start putting pressure on the current system. Younger people are moving into the area are wanting more active, walk-able neighborhoods and want to be able to safely bike with their children in tow. Pittsburgh needs to embrace this change as soon as possible, because once the South Hills is better connected, it will help all commuters, it will foster a healthier community, and it will bring the opportunities and services available in the city to all residents, regardless of income.","102","5","7","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-29 19:53:19",,"2018-06-29 19:53:19","2018-06-29 20:27:52","2018-07-01 05:21:04",,,,"2018-06-29 19:53:19","2018-07-07 00:54:05","2018-07-08 05:58:12",,,"5","4","0","0","0","5","7","0","0","0","2018-06-29 20:27:52","2018-07-01 05:21:04",,,"2018-07-07 00:54:05","2018-07-08 05:58:12",,,"5","4","0","0","0"

Across the country, cities are prioritizing walkability and establishing pedestrian programs as a top priority to improve livability and the quality of life, for all residents. In Pittsburgh, we have yet to conduct a citywide sidewalk assessment, develop a Pedestrian Master Plan, educate private property owners on their responsibilities of performing repairs on existing sidewalks, or establish a dedicated fund for subsidizing costs. By maintaining the status quo practices around sidewalk maintenance, the City’s inaction suggests that walkability and connectivity are not top priorities despite City plans, neighborhood plans, and property inventory survey data indicating it is.

Technology can also make transportation less accessible.

For the past several years I have observed that most buses when dropping off or picking up passengers will NOT pull fully into the curb lane. What they do is block both the left lane they are traveling in AND the right lane they are using for drop off, so the front of the bus is in the right lane, back is in the left lane (if this is a street with two lanes). So all traffic must stop. There is no opportunity to pass on the left, which is the correct thing to do. The bus drivers don't want to wait to get back into traffic so the best way is to block it. There must be a huge transportation traffic time cost as the result of this common practice. This should be studied anonymously both when buses do this and don't do this and behavioral changes should be made.","46","1","2","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-07-06 20:36:38",,"2018-07-06 20:36:38","2018-07-08 12:39:30","2018-07-08 12:41:51",,,,"2018-07-06 20:36:38","2018-07-08 12:39:30","2018-07-13 14:14:40",,,"1","2","0","0","0","1","2","0","0","0","2018-07-08 12:39:30","2018-07-08 12:41:51",,,"2018-07-08 12:39:30","2018-07-13 14:14:40",,,"1","2","0","0","0"

Having a good way to collect, organize, and disseminate such information is doable and many different agencies are already trying to do that (independently and usually in non-machine-readable formats).

Road transport accidents are a leading cause of death for children in the US. Importantly, a large proportion of families live within walking distance of schools – we should reduce their exposure (at least) for those trips where there is ‘no excuse’ to ‘put them in harm’s way’. In addition, one in five children in the United States are obese, due primarily to physical inactivity. Furthermore, child pick-up and drop-off have been identified in many areas as important contributors to congestion. Initiatives are thus needed to promote active travel to schools, thereby reducing mortality/injury and obesity rates in children, congestion, air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
Smartphone-based technology platforms should be developed to empower families to transfer school trips from cars to other modes. High-fidelity smartphone sensors and advances in artificial intelligence enable the automatic detection of travel mode. This provides the foundation to implement truly personalized interventions that provide real-time recommendations for people to drive less, while enabling them to arrive at their destinations even earlier (or at worst within a few minutes of their current choice). Pilot studies should be implemented across schools to test the potential of new technologies that enable the provision of individually relevant information to promote a meaningful and sustained shift in travel behavior.","23","0","0","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-07-10 03:33:38",,"2018-07-10 03:33:38",,,,,,"2018-07-10 03:33:38",,,,,"0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0",,,,,,,,,"0","0","0","0","0"

This includes things like sidewalks in good repair, with smooth curb cuts at every corner, but even that doesn't go far enough. Are the sidewalks wide enough, with no obstacles or obstructions in the pathway? No tree roots pushing the concrete up, or grass overgrowing onto the pathway?  Are the curb cuts a good, gradual angle, with no significant lip between them and the road surface?

In a city built into a mountain, as Pittsburgh is, there are a lot of hills and a lot of staircases. Those stairs make for a convenient shortcut for the able-bodied folks who can use them, but present an insurmountable barrier for people with all kinds of disabilities, not just those in wheelchairs.  When the only access to a location is via one of those tall sets of steps, it excludes the disabled by design.

When planning a City of Tomorrow, start with accessibility. Assume that people with disabilities will be present, and account for their needs from the start. Pay attention to the little details, because that can make or break your accessible design. 1 in 5 people have a disability, and we deserve to be at the table from the beginning. Whether it is public transit options, bike trails, or autonomous vehicles, make the City of Tomorrow for 100% of the people, not just the able-bodied 80%.","61","2","1","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-07-10 13:58:19",,"2018-07-10 13:58:19","2018-07-13 16:21:05","2018-07-15 16:44:38",,,,"2018-07-10 13:58:19","2018-07-15 16:42:25","2018-07-15 16:44:38",,,"2","1","0","0","0","2","1","0","0","0","2018-07-13 16:21:05","2018-07-15 16:44:38",,,"2018-07-15 16:42:25","2018-07-15 16:44:38",,,"2","1","0","0","0"
