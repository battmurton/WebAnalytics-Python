<p>Or you can read the Proposal 1 in English version below here:</p>
<p><strong>Proposal 1:</strong></p>
<strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This first solution focuses on improving traffic flow by eliminating the antiquated traffic light system created in 1868 150 years ago and replacing it with a modern system using artificial intelligence; intersections will be able to communicate with each other and decide the best flow, direction and time. It will be known in real time how many vehicles are on the streets, type of vehicles, address, speed, etc. Programming algorithms can detect drivers driving improperly under the influence of alcohol, or using the telephone, in excess of speed, etc. Canada, China, Japan, United States, etc. They face critical problems of congestion, if this proposal is implemented it could be sold to these countries.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM:</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>Congestion of the expressways, main streets and avenues of Miami.&nbsp;</strong>The expressways continue to expand, collapsing the main streets and avenues, which do not have an efficient system for controlling the flow of vehicles.</p>
<p>- <strong>Inefficient traffic light system.</strong> The traffic light system, with more than 150 years of creation, is based only on time and imprecise sensors wasting time at each intersection, waiting for drivers who travel in one direction when there are no vehicles crossing the intersection or making left. The traffic light system can not identify which road at an intersection is more congested and needs more time with the green light giving priority to more congested routes and less priority to less congested routes. The traffic lights are expensive, heavy, very prone to failures, difficult to understand with so many unnecessary lights, consume a lot of electrical energy for their operation and raw material for their manufacture, etc. The average intersections have 32 lights, which are often complex for people who are learning to drive and older people.</p>
<p>- <strong>The government is in charge of the traffic light system.</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>Streets and Avenues with multiple roads in both directions are not used in full in congestion schedules.</strong> In times of congestion streets and avenues are congested in one direction, while in the other direction only a few vehicles travel, wasting roads with multiple lanes completely empty.</p>
<p>- <strong>Accidents.&nbsp;</strong>Accidents mostly happen when drivers are distracted by relying on traffic lights that work by time or when there is congestion and are entertained in other activities such as using the phone or looking around taking off the eyes from the road. In conclusion, who causes drivers to be distracted and cause accidents are the people on charge of the signaling system and roads. While a driver is in motion, he must be attentive to traffic but when he spends more time stopping at traffic lights or in congestions he starts to get stressed and therefore seeks a distraction consequence that most of the time ends in accident.</p>
<p>- <strong>Excessive placement of traffic lights in streets and main avenues.&nbsp;</strong>Excessive traffic lights have been placed on avenues and main streets with a high volume of traffic, worsening the flow of traffic. Example: 87 Ave NW from 7 to 8 street there are three traffic lights in the same block, route which a few meters connects with expressway 836, etc.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>A private company should be in charge of the operation of this project as in Tokyo.&nbsp;</strong>Manufacturing, installation, maintenance, monitoring and being the owners.</p>
<p>- <strong>Creation of a new signaling system using tricolor LED technology, embedded cameras and OpenCV.</strong> This replaces the traffic lights of the main streets and avenues with greater congestion along with those that connect to Expressway. Example: 8th Street, Flagler, Bird Road, Coral Way, 87 bird, etc.</p>
<p>- <strong>Make modifications so that key streets and avenues can become one-way roads, in peak morning hours in one direction and in the afternoon to the other, the rest of the time will remain double track.</strong> OpenCV and LED signals control the entire flow of cars to turn streets and avenues into a single track and return them to double track whenever necessary.</p>
<p>- <strong>Give access to real-time information generated by OpenCV to the companies that manufacture GPS.</strong> The companies that manufacture GPS will be able to show in their equipment the streets with less traffic and the best routes with an unparalleled precision.</p>
<p>- <strong>Place on the expressway light signals indicating the streets or avenues of descent with fewer vehicles.</strong> These signs will be placed in the expressway every three streets or avenues that connect with the expressway and will indicate in real time which of the following three streets or avenues has fewer vehicles, in this way the driver can deduce which route is more convenient.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong></p>
<p>8 Indicators for each intersection: <strong>$ 60 for each one.</strong></p>
<p>4 Cameras per intersection: <strong>$ 4 for each one.</strong></p>
<p>1 Computer per intersection: <strong>$ 150</strong></p>
<p>Total cost per intersection: <strong>$ 644</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>BENEFITS:</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>Reduction of the cost of purchase, installation and consumption of electricity.&nbsp;</strong>Cost of purchase 75% less, installation cost 40% less and electricity consumption 80% less.</p>
<p>- <strong>Easy to understand signaling system.</strong> Instead of having 32 average lights at the current traffic lights, it will has only 8 been easier to understand and stay focused mainly for those who are learning to drive and the elderly.</p>
<p>-<strong>&nbsp;Intelligent flow control system that learns from traffic.</strong> System capable of constantly counting traffic and types of vehicles. It will recognize roads with a greater volume of vehicles. Intersections can communicate with each other in this way an intersection can communicate to the following the exact amount of vehicles that approach them and they can decide in advance how quickly they must act to make traffic flow better. Traffic will be guided by vehicle volume, direction, schedule, etc. and not just for a timer like today traffic light.</p>
<p>- <strong>Information in real time. The signals at the intersections will generate information in real time which can be used to inform drivers through GPS, apps, etc.</strong> Number of vehicles, types, direction, speed, pedestrians at intersections, etc. It will be possible to determine with greater precision the maintenance planning or modifications to the roads that need it. The system will automatically report to 911 accidents detected at the intersections, emergency teams will receive an image from 4 angles of the magnitude of the accident and will be able to arrive quickly with the necessary equipment.</p>
<p>- <strong>Reduction of accidents.</strong> This intelligent system is able to detect people in wheelchairs or elderly people at intersections and act by ordering the signals a total &quot;stop&quot;, most traffic lights only give pedestrians a few seconds to cross which is very little for elderly or disabled people and many times they are left in the middle of the street with traffic going by (I had to help a woman who did not know what to do in that situation). Drivers will be less distracted, with less traffic will be focused on reaching their destination.</p>
<p>- <strong>Better use of roads.</strong> This new signaling system can automatically add lanes in the direction in which there is more volume of vehicles to avoid congestion.</p>

<p>&quot;Water and air, the two essential fluids on which all life depends..&quot;</p>
<p>- Jacques Cousteau -</p>
<p>The AquaNAS Droneport System is a network of floating UAV takeoff and landing platforms. The system is designed with a number of intuitive safety and logistics features which are equipped to accommodate and provide flight support services to cargo carrying heavy lift UAVS and light weight parcel carrying UAVS.</p>
<p>The AquaNAS Droneport System is linked to a single mobile application, which will allow users to send and receive parcels light enough to be transported by UAV. Shipments could be initiated from strategically located newly constructed waterside State, Local or Federal emergency disaster relief fulfillment centers, participating merchants or any subscribed customer’s nearest Droneport location to a point along the network.</p>
<p>The AquaNAS’ last mile delivery sub-infrastructure will create new jobs consisting of independent contractors with on foot delivery services, human powered bicycles, battery powered bicycles, driverless electric automobiles, hybrid automobiles and the existing network of local and international courier services as well as ride sharing services to deliver parcels to a system determined AquaNAS Droneport location, where the parcel is then transported via UAV for delivery. AquaNAS Droneport System platforms will be utilized for the purpose of maintaining a safer, more controlled environment for BVOLS (Beyond Visual Line-of-Sight) flights as well as takeoffs and landings. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>AquaNAS Droneport System aircraft will be temporarily constrained to the delivery of items weighing less than 10lbs, in anticipation of heavier lifting UAVS with maximum cargo weights of up to 50lbs. Certainly, one of the most significant features of the AquaNAS Droneport System is its total dedication to the use of the surrounding waterways and the open ocean as its main flight paths. The implementation of the AquaNAS greatly reduces BVOLS risks, by eliminating the need of having to fly over people, private property and densely populated urban areas.</p>
<p>In addition, the AquaNAS will offer Emergency Management Officials a new, unique approach in the response to catastrophic events. The system contains the ability to quickly target and supply an airborne stream of life essential items to coastal areas heavily impacted by storms. There would be no need to wait on slower land based logistical supply efforts to arrive at often times confusing, previously unknown locations. With the AquaNAS, the locations are fixed and the supplies can optionally be shipped door-to-door to those in need via the last mile sub-infrastructure. This method, until now, had been previously unheard of in the vast majority recovery efforts. When utilized by the elderly, disabled and the immobilized, the AquaNAS door-to-door delivery feature can be a most effective tool. &nbsp;All AquqNAS floating droneports are designed to withstand hurricane strength weather conditions and are also designed to be self-sustainable during storm recovery periods, as each floating take-off and landing pad has the ability to house within itself, a significant amount of liquid fuel and battery supplied electricity to support aircraft utilizing the system. Thus, the system can continue to function seamlessly without any interruptions, regardless of the availability of resources. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, the exclusion of overland flights and investing in water based takeoff and landing UAV platforms also directly addresses the strong privacy and security concerns of local governments and citizens in a growing number of states. In contrast, AquaNAS flights and landings very rarely include contact with the general public as they are routinely routed over bodies of water. Initiating the AquaNAS Droneport System will be the first important step in bridging the gap of trust between Community, Industry and Regulators.</p>
<p>The AquaNAS parcel delivery system was designed to keep flights clear of people and property, and the project was created to be much less environmentally invasive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Categories of AquaNAS Droneports include the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Private: Rental, Owned or Leased by a Single Property or Individual (Waterside Homes, Condominiums, Apartment Buildings.)</p>
<p>2. Commercial: Owned or Leased to be utilized by one or more Businesses.</p>
<p>3. Government: Owned or Leased to be utilized exclusively by Local, State or Federal Government</p>
<p>4. Community: Community Owned or Leased which will be accessible to both the General Public and Businesses.</p>
<p>All AquaNAS floating UAV platforms are designed to be easily installed without the costly and oftentimes difficult construction process associated with the traditional pylon supported dock structures. AquaNAS platforms use only the existing seawall as its anchor and each platform utilizes a number of hinge and sliding rail components that allow the platform to adjust with the changing tides as it remains at its fixed location with minimal environmental impact.&nbsp;</p>","Franklin Brown

1. Faster restaurant food deliveries: restaurants can instantly expand their customer base beyond current delivery ranges.
2. Delivery of unavailable pharmaceutical prescriptions shipped in from neighboring counties or cities.
3. Immediate delivery of critical medical supplies, blood, organs and samples for testing. 
4. Fast delivery of items normally requiring trips via personal vehicles or public transportation. 
5. Extended hours of international parcel delivery services. 
6. Elderly, disabled and immobilized: storm victims in or near heavily damaged coastal areas supported by the AquaNAS can expect faster disaster response times via door-to-door relief items deliveries 24 hours a day during recovery periods.
7. Local Governments: Entities seeking a safer, more controlled method to integrate UAV technology into their communities will have an added measure of privacy protection.

In every state of United Sates there’s construction, there's red lights &nbsp;and they don’t have traffic like this, and that is because as easy as it sound everything starts in who or how we learn to drive, at least here in Miami Dade we have heard so many times the expression when someones drives bad &quot;Ohh did you get your license in Hialeah&quot;. At least me, i heard that expression really frequently, and that because in Miami Dade it is so easy to get a license, the exam to get your license its on really empty street, or on a stop sign, and you are not really getting tested, so when you start driving on highways or in a street with congestion, the people start panicking and that is how accidents and bad drivers start. That is only the begging of something bigger and worse.</p>

When the people going to work or to the school starts creating better relationships with the people they share ride with, because they are socializing and living more among them. We can see how it reduces the violence problems between students or coworkers in schools or jobs.

<p>Ask just about anyone in Miami-Dade what is our worst problem and the most likely answer you’ll get is “traffic”. Miami ranks at the bottom of any driving-related lists. Rush hours now extend three or four hours and it is considered normal to take 30 – 45 minutes to go 5 or 6 miles.</p>
<p>In addition to the sheer number of cars, there are two other factors making our traffic even more traffic: there is no room to expand our roads and public transportation is a pathetic joke. Metrorail (or Metro-Fail as it is often called) is just a straight line from the west (Kendall) to the east (Downtown). But Miami-Dade itself is totally spread out.</p>
<p>Combined Metrorail and Metromover ridership is around 2.3 million per month (of which 2.0 million are during weekdays). Assuming most people will ride back and forth and that 75% of them are the same people every day, this could be as little as 600,000 individual persons per month.</p>
<p>Bus ridership is around 4.6 million per month. This is minute fraction of the around 9 – 10 million trips made per day in Miami Dade. (NTHS Data 2009 projected to 2017 population). So the data is grim: public transportation serves a small fraction of our transportation needs.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, the political establishment has not been able to come up with any solutions. Clich&eacute; solutions like trains are expensive (into the $2bn+) and take years to build.</p>
<p>From a potential user perspective, there are five key priorities:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Footprint – The solution must be able to get people from where they live to where they want to go, be it work, beach, shopping, etc.</li>
 <li>Flexibility – As needs or passenger volume changes, the solution chosen must be flexible enough to accommodate these changes with no major disruptions.</li>
 <li>Frequency – Obviously, passenger waiting must be kept at a comfortable minimum. This will change but, for example, no one wants to wait over 15 minutes during rush hours.</li>
 <li>Low cost – If people are going to use public transportation regularly, it must be relatively inexpensive. As it relates to highly congested areas, it must be cheaper than, say, parking in downtown Miami ($10 - $14 all day) or cheaper than the gas used to go to work.</li>
 <li>Remove congestion – Finally, it would be great if the solution were able to really get rid of cars on the road.</li>
</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Proposal –three key factors:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Minibus fleet</li>
 <li>Private/Public partnership</li>
 <li>Technology used for route optimization</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The proposal:</p>
<p>1. Minibus Fleet.</p>
<p>Have Miami-Dade County create a fleet of 14-passenger mini-buses, leasing them to individual owner-operators and sharing the revenues.</p>
<p>The buses.</p>
<p>Minibuses come in several configurations. These particular buses typically carry 14 passengers, weigh about 11,000 lbs and have a wheelbase of 158”, so that the total length equals that of one and a half cars. At around 8-10 mpg they consume pretty much what a Mercedes G63 Wagon does. But, at $55,000 - $60,000 these buses cost half as much as a Mercedes G Wagon.</p>
<p>A fleet of minibuses also makes sense two other ways:</p>
<p>First, the fleet can be shut off during the weekend, if needed, when ridership is low.</p>
<p>Second, the buses are absolutely easy to maintain; these, in particular, are Fords and use commonly available engines, drivetrains, brakes, suspensions and other parts.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>2. The Economics of a Public/Private Partnership</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, our 2.2 million people take around 3.8 car trips per day for the 9-10 million calculations. (NTHS Data). No amount of buses, metro-rails and metromovers can even begin to impact that figure. However, a fleet of 7,000 minibuses would begin to duplicate the ridership capacity of Metrorail + Metromover. Moreover, if most of the car trips are relatively short and single-person, it is conceivable that 7,000 minibuses could remove 70,000 cars off our roads per day.</p>
<p>A fleet of 7,000 minibuses would cost $385 million or, roughly, 20% of the cost of the equivalent Metrorail capacity.</p>
<p>What would the economics of a public/private partnership look like?</p>
<p>I propose that Miami-Dade buy the buses (through issuing bonds or securing the debt of the private citizen buying the bus) and then “sell” them to individual owners. In order to avoid an undue concentration of power and replicate the failed cab industry, one can visualize an arbitrary limit on individual ownership (10? 5?) and, in order to qualify owners the government could mandate that all owners/drivers pay for the driving lessons out of their own pockets.</p>
<p>Is this affordable and attractive?</p>
<p>My calculations show that yes, after about 180 passengers per day, minibus ownership is an attractive self-employment option:</p>

<p>So it is realistic that an owner/driver make $1,500 per week, which is high compared to the Miami-Dade average yearly income of $58,000.</p>
<p>Miami-Dade would make money by selling advertising on the buses. 7,000 buses selling billboards on the side for as little as $350/month (for both) would generate $2.5 million per month, which would help pay for the bureaucracy and have money left over to pay drivers a performance bonus. Subcontracting the commercialization to a company such as ClearChannel could be done for 25% - 30% commission, which would still leave plenty of money per month.</p>
<p>3. Technology used for traffic optimization</p>
<p>Finally, an app similar to Uber’s would measure demand and supply, making sure buses are driven to where they are needed most.</p>
<p>This app could also measure the performance of each bus, making sure that buses receive proper maintenance, keeping track of MPG figures, driver license renewals, etc.</p>
<p>Bottom line:</p>
<p>A public/private partnership which would create thousands of jobs can be achieved by the country “buying” a large fleet of minibuses and “selling” them to individual owners. This fleet would be highly efficient in reacting to traffic needs and improve our traffic conditions measurably.</p>","Right now, there is no team.

<p>It has become evident that serious transportation improvements need to be across Miami-Dade County, especially along SW 8th Street in front of FIU. In the aftermath of the FIU Bridge Collapse, we need to realize that building roads upon roads has gotten us in trouble in the first place, as we continuously construct our municipalities around single-car, single-passenger journeys. That's why the time has come to revamp a section of SW 8th Street to make way for multi-modal transport, all while improving traffic flow at the same time.</p>
<p>As a result, this six-part proposal emphasizes the urgency to rebuild our transportation infrastructure around multi-modal transport to move people and goods in a more efficient manner.</p>
<p><strong>First:</strong> In order to make room for at-grade construction, while keeping Miami's traffic problems in mind, an east-west tunnel needs to be built directly beneath the existing SW 8th Street to allow thru traffic can speed through the area without interfering with local traffic. This would improve traffic safety on both levels since different portals will carry east and westbound traffic, reducing the risk of head-on collisions, and eliminating the need to drive across several lanes of traffic, just to access Sweetwater and FIU.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>As a bonus, the tunnel should also get turnpike access (in both directions) so that motorists won't have to cross several lanes of traffic to access the turnpike, or enter the tunnels, to further improve traffic flow. This would help in emergency evacuations since it would enable Monroe County residents access to the FIU Shelter while expediting evacuations of Miami-Dade County residents and FIU Students.</em></p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>: Once thru traffic has been diverted to the tunnels, SW 8th Street can be transformed from an 8 lane highway into a 5 lane &quot;boulevard&quot; from SW 107th Avenue to SW 117th Avenue: complete with widened sidewalks on both sides of the roadway, and a bike trail in the median.</p>
<p>Since the current sidewalks are dangerous, and possibly outdated, they should be replaced with wider, more colorful sidewalks to build around pedestrian-friendly development. In addition, the lack of bike trails stimulates the addition of a bike trail in the median, to give bicyclists their own space without interfering with automobile traffic.</p>
<p><strong style=""font-family: ford-antenna; font-size: 18px; background-color: initial; text-align: initial;"">Third:&nbsp;</strong><span style=""font-family: ford-antenna; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 200; background-color: initial; text-align: initial;"">Construct a cross-walk across the revamped SW 8th Street (where it meets SW 117th Avenue), and a footbridge across the canal to provide improved pedestrian access to a nearby elementary school and public park.</span></p>
<p><em>This would stimulate additional bike trails to be constructed along SW 8th Street and SW 117th Avenue to promote walking and bicycling as alternatives to single-car, single passenger trips.</em></p>
<p><strong>Fourth:</strong> To bring much-needed transit extensions and upgrades to the FIU Campus and surrounding areas, why not supplement the &quot;Panther Station&quot; development by adding an adjacent Metrorail station to the proposed bus terminal, and a mezzanine level walkway (connecting Metrorail with Panther Station and PG 6) to streamline transit connections.</p>
<p><em>This would further signify &quot;Panther Station's&quot; importance as a transit hub while stimulating much-needed transit extensions and upgrades (especially Metrorail-related ones) throughout Miami-Dade County.</em></p>
<p><strong>Fifth:</strong> To emphasize the importance of green spaces, an elevated park should be built above the revamped SW 8th Street (from Panther Station to the Emergency Ambulatory Center) in memory of those who lost their lives in the FIU Bridge Collapse.</p>
<p><em>This would also give Sweetwater residents and FIU students, faculty, and staff a new place to hang out, in addition to highlight Miami-Dade County's initiative to promote public parks.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sixth</strong>: As the finishing touch, the Sweetwater-FIU Bridge can be rebuilt (but sturdier this time) to give pedestrians direct access between the City of Sweetwater and the FIU Campus. Unlike the failed bridge (which was only a single north-south walkway), the rebuilt structure will provide two walkways, and a bike path, on three levels to set it apart from other pedestrian bridges, along with motivating future cities to pilot similar proposals.</p>
<p><em>As the centerpiece of the revamped SW 8th Street, the rebuilt Sweetwater-FIU Bridge will celebrate the redevelopment of SW 8th Street in front of FIU from a mega-highway into a multi-modal, multi-level corridor to set an example for other municipalities to move away from single-car, single passenger journeys.</em></p>",,"I am submitting as an individual","For motorists, they would experience easier commutes since thru traffic would no longer interfere with FIU traffic, giving them faster, easier, and safer commutes through the area.

For transit riders, they would be to access Metrorail without having to take a bus Downtown, and/or connect with buses through a consolidated transit center. This would increase ridership as it would persuade people to use transit as opposed to driving.

For pedestrians, they would be able to access the FIU Campus and the City of Sweetwater without having to cross SW 8th Street, giving Sweetwater residents instant access to the Intermodal Center and the FIU Campus (In addition to enhancing pedestrian safety).

Overall, FIU Students, Faculty, and Staff would benefit the most as campus traffic and parking garage overcrowding would be relieved dramatically (as fewer cars would be on the road).  Also, they would have more time to study, socialize, and do other things without stressing over traffic.","Initial Design - you are still exploring the idea and have not tested it with users",,"For this proposal, I plan on making a video proposal, outlining the exact footprint of the project to convince the public that this is a good idea, and should be looked into.",,"36","0","4","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-07-16 20:39:58","2018-07-16 20:43:35",,,"2018-07-17 14:33:42",,,"2018-08-02 16:19:42",,,"2018-07-25 17:50:40",,,"0","3","0","0","0","0","4","0","0","0",,"2018-07-17 14:33:42",,,,"2018-07-25 17:50:40",,,"0","3","0","0","0"

Each parties receive confirmation through the app and other channel of their choice (email, sms, etc). 
Possibility to extend the use to private business owning parking slots (manage in more flexible way the pricing for specific events etc.).
Consequence: less cars on the roads while searching for parking, improved driver experience, decreased traffic in jammed areas.","Initial Design - you are still exploring the idea and have not tested it with users","$100,000","Phase 1: technical development of the backend and front end of the MVP one one OS (either iOS or Android)

Registered vehicles would pay a yearly fee, which would be used solely on new mobility projects, similar to those ideas of the the Ford Challenge. Other uses would include: the construction of new bike paths, planting of trees along walkways and bike paths, issuing vouchers to bike riders that may be used at bike shops that offer free bike safety classes and discounts on monthly transit passes, just to name a few. Vehicles found to be in violation of the Green Zone restriction will be cited by law enforcement with considerable fines.

The CMA would exist as a totally separate independent authority charged with overseeing the funds and creating and implementing new mobility projects countywide. Politically, the creation of the CMA would offer a great deal of cover for county elected officials from having to face backlash for implementing the Green Zones. Elderly car owners, vehicle owners with disablities and residents living within Green Zone areas could register their vehicles at a discounted rate. Discounted rates could also be applied to company fleet vehicles, ride sharing and taxis that utilize the Green Zones during restricted hours.

<p>Zing has developed a state-of-the-art application platform for IOS, Android and web easily downloadable via the App store or Google Play. Parents have the option of requesting a ride on demand or pre-booking rides well in advance. &nbsp;With just a few clicks, parents can register a child and add specific pick-up and drop off addresses at designated times and dates. &nbsp;With the pre-booking option, parents can schedule their child's transportation needs a week or even a month out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Zing Rides staff will also work together with the families and the schools providing all the necessary resources for a successful IEP during the entire school year, making sure all the children's needs with special riding assistance are met.</p>
<p>Communication and transparency are key values for the Zing brand. Tracking rides and instant communication capabilities via status notifications are two of the more prominent features of our app. &nbsp; Each time a ride is booked, parents will get three notifications during a child’s trip.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By having vetted drivers that are community members on our platform, Zing is helping by enabling them to increase their monthly income while also keeping our kids safe and reducing traffic congestion.</p>

With just a few clicks, parents can register a child and add specific pick-up and drop off addresses at designated times and dates.  With the pre-booking option, parents can schedule their child's transportation needs a week or even a month out.Daily bookable schedules are inclusive of going to school, attending an after-school activity, doctor's appointment, therapy, partaking in social events, and carpooling with other children. Busy parents who are juggling their family schedules as well as work schedules need a safe and reliable alternative to help them with transportation on a weekly basis. Paying a little extra for a quality driver whom they will have 100% access to their background qualifies as the type of service that parents demand.","Pilot - you have implemented your solution in a real-world scenario; Ready to Scale - you have completed and expanded your pilot and are seeing adoption of your solution by your intended user","$100,000","With this grant, Zing will further develop the app to continue to service kids and special assistance rides abiding by all state and federal requirements.  Our goal is to make urban life better in any county we go into. This grant will also have the benefit of having an already complete product that required months of planning, coding flawless UX and UI and that is looking into launching and scaling to all of FL.  Zing will hire a team of customer service consisting of US Veterans ONLY.  The pilot program has already seen success with 3000 rides, zero attrition of drivers as well as the families using the service. After 6 months piloting, we are now transporting families who attend 12 different schools. Rides to important medical non-emergency treatments allowed kids to finish treatments through the pilot program at Mt. Sinai and Children's Hospital. Families are already paying for the rides as well as a few businesses sponsoring the rides to their clients. We will continue to scale.","Success to Zing Rides is measured by every carpooling participant taking another car off the road, which means less congested roads and highways. As more kids take part in carpooling programs or organize carpools within their schools and activities, overall traffic congestion will decrease, which reduces fuel consumption, commute time, and the cost of road repairs in addition to reducing the amount of time and cars spent on carpool lanes. Income being generated by parent drivers will help a family during their monthly bills while also have a positive environmental impact.  On a clinical side, children often times miss the opportunity to complete their medical treatments due to transportation.  With Zing Rides, they will no longer need to miss doctors appointments. For the community of kids requiring additional special assistance and which often times end up having a long wait for their rides, Zing will be there to regain the level of respect and attention they need to be on time.","103","0","4","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-07-19 17:41:28","2018-07-19 18:11:03","2018-07-24 00:01:15",,"2018-07-24 12:17:19",,,"2018-07-24 16:19:01","2018-07-24 00:01:15",,"2018-07-24 16:20:39",,,"0","2","0","0","0","0","4","0","0","0",,"2018-07-24 12:17:19",,,,"2018-07-24 16:20:39",,,"0","2","0","0","0"

Additionally, Papa connects local colleges students to an opportunity to support others in their community. Members (Older Adults) pay $20 per hour which includes up to 10 miles of service. Additional miles are $.50 per mile. We track this automatically in our technology. 

The students get requests on their mobile app and can accepted ones in their area. Students get paid for this and have a flexible schedule.

We already have the foundational infrastructure in place to support this pilot and beyond. We are excited to see the value of our solution to this problem and believe it is going to be very valuable to residents. We have already proven this to be accurate. We have about 200 members in Miami as of today.

Our average customer in Miami spends $172 per month with the service to take members to and stay with them at the doctor, the grocery store, or other locations. We make about 30% of the collected revenue, with the majority going to the students.","One measure of success will be how many members we are able to enroll through this channel. We also want to evaluate repeat usage throughout the pilot program. We would track this cohort closely and look for ways to improve through the pilot offering. Our intention after the pilot would be to roll it out to more members in the Miami market and expand to other similar geographies.

Beyond social transportation the ""Grandkids On-Demand"" can also provide house help, tech help, and most importantly; companionship. If they want services beyond social transportation, we charge a monthly membership fee. Reviewing the users and seeing how many go from social transportation to membership will also be a clear sign of success. We will closely track usage over time.

<p>Inspired by <em>Sweatcoin,&nbsp;</em>I would like to develop an app that allows its users to earn actual money by walking. Ideally the app would allow the user to get a weekly pay, discounts from stores, restaurants, etc., and a chance for paid commutes to and from work.</p>
<p>The app will work with a number of businesses to provide these discounts and deals, and to gain revenue to give back to the users. There will also be a monthly membership fee to ensure user commitment.</p>

  <p>In addition device can be solar powered and will be attached to a structure that can be identified at a distance because at the top it will have a light that will distinguish it from the rest of the street structures found in the city. Because buses are critical in hurricane and evacuations, Miami-Dade can utilize these displays for evacuation to better communicate transport messages and upcoming shelter pickup bus data.

Tax revenue from toll rates, registration & plate rates, and a new resort ""green"" rate for all hotels and home share sites as well as contibutions from major developers benefiting from the increase of visitors to their shops and restaurants would keep funding this expansion.","Sustainability will be measured by an account of ridership use and be observed by traffic on toll routes during rush hour a year after full implementation.  Also, a year after the walkway being built, measurement of crowds using it and attendance to events and markets will be measured.  Last, a detailed survey would be mailed out before and after implementation to evaluate use as well as research directly input into smart grid system to help evaluate ways to continually get more efficient at serving the needs of the community which may expand over time.  Donations to green expansion from income tax returns evaluated as well as a concerted marketing effort for donations from local financial institutions be measured.  Positive press for the city will only increase its coffers--especially if we get chosen as a new Amazon headquarters for example--imagine the compounded increased benefits.

I've heard for years there's no room for more highways due to the tight patches of land and the surrounding water. so, why not use waterways?!?!? I was in Europe this year and in a small town in Italy, they had ships that would carry you across a huge lake, cars included. So why not use the same systems to connect Miami Beach to the main land? as we stand there are only a handful of ways to commute in and out of the Beach. 5th, 41st, 79, 163, and 191st (i think, the Aventura bridge) most of which suffer from added 'boat traffic' which sometimes cause the bridge to 'break' for an hour, and have huge car traffic delays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having Public boats that take people and cars from added designated areas (like Haulouver Beach Park, or the new park next to the American Airlines Arena to South BEach) would definitely alleviate congestion on the few and archaic bridges we currently rely on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A step further would be to create public boatlines that use waterways that connect &nbsp;from Aventura to Downtown. This would not only be an &quot;attraction&quot; that would make people want to use them, but again it would even make sense for people to leave their cars back home and commute to work using these alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea of making cards that could work for transfering from the bus to the water bus would also make connections a breeze.</p>
<p>I used the Metro Rail for the first time after 18 years of living in Miami, and it was great. Why did I waited so long? because there are very few stations and none by house. Also, I feel most people even know about its convenience! there is no major marketing around it, so people can't use what they don't know about. connecting these 3 forms of commuting (busses, waterways, and metro rail with added connections from east to west) would reduce traffic significantly.&nbsp;</p>",,"I am submitting as an individual","Who will use it -
-working people that live in downtown but commute to Aventura for working. A person walks to Museum Park in Downtown. Adds money to their public transportation card pass and boards the waterbus. the boat starts its journey to the water highway that has direct and unobstructed access to Aventura by cruising between Biscayne Blvd and A1A. direct line with no stops to Aventura. No traffic, nostops. 

A woman living in south Beach takes the waterbuss to cross to the mainland without having to connect on 2 busses that go around the water. instead, she takes the waterbus which uses the water as a highway to get her to hr destination.

a tourist couple staying in the mainland uses the waterbus to reach the bal harbor shops mall where they want to go shopping. after spending the day at the shops and restaurants around they take the same line back to their hotel in the main land and marvel at the views from their waterbus.","Initial Design - you are still exploring the idea and have not tested it with users",,,,"23","0","0","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-08-01 16:45:23",,"2018-08-01 16:45:23",,,,,,"2018-08-01 16:45:23",,,,,"0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0",,,,,,,,,"0","0","0","0","0"

<p>After conducting a brief survey, I have learned that many peoples objections to taking public transportation in Miami are the following:</p>
<p>1) It takes too long. I live approximately 10 miles from where I work and yet it would take me almost an hour to get to work because I'd have to take two different buses that have a total of 24 stops along the way.</p>
<p>2) The crowd.</p>
<p>3) Inconvenience of payment. Many people were confused about whether they had to use a metro card or pay with exact change in order to take the current options for public transportation in Miami.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brisk Lines would solve all of that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's how it works: A person would enter their commute information: where they live, where they work, the days and times they need to go to and from work. As more and more people enter their information, our technology will match people who are going to and from the same general area and create a &quot;bus line&quot; for them. People can also create a line themselves, and once enough people show interest in that line by joining that line, Brisk Lines will start one of our medium sized 20-30 passenger buses to start driving that route.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros: No line will have more than 5 stops total to ensure speedy arrival. All payments can be done via the app. The bus can be tracked via the app, so no need to worry about whether or not it's coming. It's a great way to meet your neighbors and people who work close to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will save commuters money and will reduce traffic for other commuters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think a small pilot program could start in two or three dense areas within Miami.&nbsp;</p>","Currently my team is Me, Myself, and I but I have discussed the idea with handful of resourceful acquaintances of mine and they are on board to contribute on an as needed basis.","I am submitting as an individual","Imagine a woman named Sheila. Sheila lives in Sunny Isles and works downtown. Her commute takes between 45-1hr and 15 minutes on average. In addition to the sitting in traffic and ware and tare on her car, she pays $200/month to park downtown.  She has desperately been searching for  a way to stop commuting. She loves her job, but has even started looking for a new one because of the stress of the commute. She finds out about Brisk Lines. She puts in her info into the app and finds out that there are 20 other people in her high-rise that commute to downtown everyday around the same time as she does. Brisk Lines matches these people and alerts them that a line is being created for them. Since they all live in the same building it will leave from the front of their building and make only two stops in downtown Miami. Sheila is so happy. Not only is she getting to know her neighbors, but the commute is affordable and stress free.","Initial Design - you are still exploring the idea and have not tested it with users","$100,000","I have some web development experience and would build the app (with some help from other developers). The pilot would be launching in two dense areas such as Aventura, Sunny Isles, or Miami Beach.  We would rent two 24 passenger buses once the lines are created. Initially to drum up interested, we would offer the first week for free. The cost per ride would be calculated based on distance. Monthly passes would be available as well. Revenue streams would be as follows: 1) pay per single ride, 2)monthly pass, 3) bus ad space (advertisements on the bus and on the outside of the bus), and  4) app partnerships with companies. So eventually if a large company or residential building wants to create a line with us we will charge a monthly member ship fee/ corporate rate. One potential partnership I foresee is with co-working spaces. They are companies of the future and could benefit from having a private bus line that picks up and drops off from their co-working space .","Success would be measured by the number of riders in a time period and the amount of profit that is generated. In order to be sustainable there has to be enough profit to reinvest into acquiring buses, hiring employees, maintenance, improving technology, etc. So, if Brisk Lines can grow into a sustainable business (meaning profitable  with fully paid employees, and in a growth stage within a certain period) it is a success.","20","1","2","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-08-02 05:55:28",,"2018-08-02 05:55:28","2018-08-02 14:13:54","2018-08-02 15:31:29",,,,"2018-08-02 05:55:28","2018-08-02 14:13:54","2018-08-02 15:44:08",,,"1","2","0","0","0","1","2","0","0","0","2018-08-02 14:13:54","2018-08-02 15:31:29",,,"2018-08-02 14:13:54","2018-08-02 15:44:08",,,"1","2","0","0","0"

We would hire 1 FTE to run operations in this test market and to be Sheprd’s liaison.

We would roll this out with 5-10 drivers and 5-10 parents to test its viability.
Similarly to our core market of Newton, MA, we would scale beyond the pilot by; a) raising additional capital to keep expanding operations + sales / marketing in this new market; b) convert to gross profitability in Year 2, to start paying down operating costs and ultimately create a self-sustainable business model.","We would look at similar metrics that we look at our in our current markets, including: 1) Customer re-booking rate (to get a sense of customer satisfaction); 2) Pickup / dropoff on time % (measure of Operational performance); 3) ride booking growth WoW;","9","0","0","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-08-02 15:54:44",,"2018-08-02 15:54:44",,,,,,"2018-08-02 15:54:44",,,,,"0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0",,,,,,,,,"0","0","0","0","0"
