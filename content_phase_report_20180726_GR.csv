According to the above site, streetcars were used in Grand Rapids from 1865 to 1935. At one point, GR even had the most modern streetcar system in the country! 

https://www.ridetherapid.org/assets/files/1/final-grand

Now read this excerpt from the opening message of a 2014 study (link above), written by former GR mayor, John H. Logie:
“In the 1890s there were streetcars all around Grand Rapids, with tracks from downtown out to Reeds Lake before East Grand Rapids became a city. We were in the process of changing over from horsedrawn to electric-powered vehicles supplied by wires mounted on buildings above the tracks. We even had a San Francisco-like cable car to get up and down the Michigan Street hill. Our streetcars were replaced by buses and automobiles many years ago, but our community still needs better mobility for our residents and visitors and new economic development opportunities to create jobs and sustain growth. Now, fast forward almost 100 years. Desiring to build upon Grand Rapids 'streetcar legacy,' in the last several months, the Streetcar Advisory Committee has been hard at work to identify what will become the first streetcar to begin running through downtown since the last one shut down in the 1930’s...""","143","1","4","0","0","0","1","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-27 17:55:21","2018-06-27 17:56:59","2018-06-27 17:55:21","2018-06-28 23:07:56","2018-06-27 19:25:26",,"2018-06-28 13:55:11","2018-06-27 18:01:46","2018-06-27 17:55:21","2018-06-28 23:07:56","2018-06-28 14:07:48",,"2018-06-28 13:55:11","1","3","0","0","1","1","4","0","0","1","2018-06-28 23:07:56","2018-06-27 19:25:26",,"2018-06-28 13:55:11","2018-06-28 23:07:56","2018-06-28 14:07:48",,"2018-06-28 13:55:11","1","3","0","0","1"

Building new, small lots that have a variety of public use chargers would go a long way to help people in our community make smarter and greener car buying decisions. These chargers should be made available at rates that are affordable, or free, to encourage EV purchases. We should offer charge ports that not only work with a large variety of vehicles, but also offer the capability of doing DC Fast charges to get people on their way if need be. These lots should be placed on or very near public transit routes that take people to major points of interest - the VanAndel Arena, 20 Monroe, UICA, Ionia Ave, and Bridge Street on the west side, to promote local business, or help employees that work there and need to charge their EVs. 

The barriers to EV adoption in Grand Rapids should be as low as possible, or non existent. If Milton Keynes in the UK can have a substantial number of EV adopters in the past decade, I see no reason why Grand Rapids shouldn't be able to do the same in a similar amount of time.","128","2","8","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-27 19:21:42",,"2018-06-27 19:21:42","2018-06-27 22:15:35","2018-06-27 22:19:20",,,,"2018-06-27 19:21:42","2018-06-28 23:07:58","2018-06-29 20:24:48",,,"2","5","0","0","0","2","8","0","0","0","2018-06-27 22:15:35","2018-06-27 22:19:20",,,"2018-06-28 23:07:58","2018-06-29 20:24:48",,,"2","5","0","0","0"

Some of my co-workers envy my access to the bus line, saying that they wish they could bus in bad weather, but with the transfers and wait times, it'd take them over an hour to get to work, where it only takes them 20 minutes to drive.

How can we make public transit not just something we associate with the underprivileged, the students, and the hip city dwellers? How can we make it just as easy for a friend living in Grandville to take a bus to Eastown as it is for the friend down town?

Perhaps we could draw inspiration from cities where public transit is the norm, like DC, or Munich.","182","5","8","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-28 13:55:11",,"2018-06-28 13:55:11","2018-06-28 14:08:37","2018-06-28 22:55:11",,,,"2018-06-28 13:55:11","2018-07-09 17:30:30","2018-07-03 02:18:15",,,"5","4","0","0","0","5","8","0","0","0","2018-06-28 14:08:37","2018-06-28 22:55:11",,,"2018-07-09 17:30:30","2018-07-03 02:18:15",,,"5","4","0","0","0"

The trail ends at the intersection of Grand River Dr SE/Riverside Dr and Montcalm Ave SE. Currently very few people can easily utilize the trail, and those that do only use it for recreation, and most have to travel to it in vehicles. It could be extended by removing the dangerous and rarely used tracks that run along the Grand River through Lowell, Ada, Cascade, East Grand Rapids, Midtown and across the Grand River at Riverside Park and be connected to the White Pine Trail.  The new Trail would provide an excellent pedestrian highway just as the White Pine Trail does running north, only in a more urban environment allowing thousands of commuters to safely bike to work, and also add a route for recreation for 10's of thousands of people without having to drive out of town. It would also increase public safety and property values, while removing 100's of cars per day from overcrowded roads like Michigan Street, Leonard, Cascade, Fulton, and many other Roads. It would open up commuting by bike and other types of non-motorized traffic by connection two great existing trails through the city. The trail would provide a safe means of transportation from Ionia, through Lowell, past Amway, through Cascade and Forest Hills, into East Grand Rapids and through Midtown over the river and north to Rockford and all the way up to Cadillac.","99","6","3","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-06-28 14:12:20","2018-06-28 14:14:02","2018-06-28 14:12:20","2018-06-28 19:39:30","2018-06-28 22:41:12",,,"2018-06-28 14:14:02","2018-06-28 14:12:20","2018-07-12 03:30:14","2018-06-29 19:26:08",,,"6","2","0","0","0","6","3","0","0","0","2018-06-28 19:39:30","2018-06-28 22:41:12",,,"2018-07-12 03:30:14","2018-06-29 19:26:08",,,"6","2","0","0","0"

Now we have to pay a consultant $100,000 to tell us why people are not riding buses?    I will let you in on a little secret, the economy is good so ridership will be down.    Continuing to close traffic lanes to make bus-only lanes will exacerbate the problem not help.  Of course, we need public transit, but we are not Chicago, LA, Detroit or New York City and it should not be a competition to become like them.  We need a Grand Rapids solution to a Grand Rapids problem not to emulate a larger cities program.  To me this means more parking garages, not parking lots, five plus story tall garages on the outskirts of the city.   Park and then walk or ride a bike the next mile or so you need to go.

When evaluating rideshare transportation for seniors, those with disabilities and our youth, we uncovered very few options were affordable or convenient - much less on demand. At Kboose, we believe it would be amazing if those needing a little extra assistance could get around as easily as businessmen and bar patrons by utilizing a rideshare platform that is companion based. Further, this companion based option  is needed because the vast majority of the rideshare industry is racing towards driverless options a Kboose feels that is is important to embrace the driver and make them an important part of the solution of this demographic providing a safe empowering transportation option.
Our Goals 
What if we could eliminate much of the bussed transportation at retirement facilities, eliminating their liability, the cost of buses, upkeep and drivers and ultimately reduced the cost of retirement operating expenses? What if group homes no longer needed vans - and in addition to reduced costs, we improve quality of life through normalcy? What if retirees could live at home longer because they had affordable and available transportation when they stop driving? What if the visually impaired could trust a driver would come look for them, and what if parents didn't have to risk their jobs when they had to scramble to provide unplanned transportation for their children?
Our contribution has been to pilot and test our idea in Grand Rapids and the surrounding  communities.","585","5","8","0","0","0","2","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-07-02 19:38:18","2018-07-02 19:42:10","2018-07-02 19:38:19","2018-07-02 19:45:15","2018-07-03 02:00:07",,"2018-07-03 20:42:43","2018-07-02 20:23:51","2018-07-02 19:38:19","2018-07-03 10:44:49","2018-07-06 13:17:39",,"2018-07-04 02:55:24","5","3","0","0","1","5","8","0","0","2","2018-07-02 19:45:15","2018-07-03 02:00:07",,"2018-07-03 20:42:43","2018-07-03 10:44:49","2018-07-06 13:17:39",,"2018-07-04 02:55:24","5","3","0","0","1"

And, that train is a very real part of the inspiration behind a dream that I've had for Grand Rapids for many years.

In 2014 I was reading the results of a feasibility study conducted by GR Forward regarding the economic impact of a proposed underground parking lot.  The study concluded that the addition of 1500 parking spaces would translate to more than $1,006,000,000.00 of increased economic activity.  Unfortunately, the cost of underground parking was estimated to cost upwards of $70,000.00 per parking space, and the initiative was deemed not feasible.

Being the kind of person who says ""Challenge Accepted"" when the opportunity to unlock a billion dollars in economic activity knocks - I started digging.

I was looking for a solution that would deliver 1500 parking spots, as close as possible to downtown, that could be completed for the lowest price.

In short, I concluded that a surface lot constructed atop Butterworth #2 subsidized by brownfield credits, and connected via Aerial Tram, over the river, to underutilized city property along Market Street makes for a sublime solution.

The beauty of this solution is it's two-fold benefit.  It not only provides 1500 parking spots at a tiny fraction of the cost of an underground lot, it also provides a means of transport from our growing downtown out to Millennium Park.

And it's just really, really cool.","2","0","0","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-07-02 21:02:14",,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0",,,,,,,,,"0","0","0","0","0"

She considered all her options to get there..(her son couldn't take her, the Uber drives off without her, Taxis and Van rides are too expensive and the Bus route is too far away) She choose the Go bus(a subsidised bus that can pick you up if you're approved and qualify, and take you to Doctors appointments. It fills its schedule by working others in when possible with no guarantee of time of arrival or departure. In other words, you get there when you get there.) So the Go Bus couldn't guarantee a ride on that morning, but it was able to squeeze her in. The bus picked her up on a cold snowy November morning at 6 am and dropped her off at 6: 20. For 100 minutes - a little over an 1-1/2 she stood outside waiting for someone to open the door. I was angry that was the best we could do!

Our closest is at Fulton and Carlton and if we want a full service Meijer for cost savings we are traveling to Cascade, Alpine or Knapps Corner. I have a craft hobby that sends me to 28th street weekly. My husband has band gigs around Kent County.

All of these things, at present, make it such that we maintain two vehicles to keep up with running about town. I've certainly considered the possibility of what it would mean to drop to one car. The Rapid goes up and down our main intersection near home. We walk everywhere that we can, nightly. We have bikes. We have moped scooters, even. But at the end of all of it, we've found that we just have to maintain two vehicles to be able to keep up with our lives.

I'm curious how big city residents have transitioned to a more urban lifestyle found in big cities. Being a rapidly growing mid-size city, we just haven't reached that break point yet","90","0","3","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-07-10 01:19:57",,"2018-07-10 01:19:57",,"2018-07-10 02:47:13",,,,"2018-07-10 01:19:57",,"2018-07-11 13:13:26",,,"0","3","0","0","0","0","3","0","0","0",,"2018-07-10 02:47:13",,,,"2018-07-11 13:13:26",,,"0","3","0","0","0"

But have you ever stopped to think about how fast East Hills area turned into the walkable area everyone wanted it to be? Growing up in mid Michigan, Grand Rapids was never, ever a place that we ever visited. We went to Detroit, Saginaw and Traverse City (and other states) for dance competitions and soccer tournaments. But we never came to GR. The suburban sprawl and evacuation of downtown commercial real estate I guess had an impact farther reaching than just the county Grand Rapids resides in.

But when I came to Grand Valley, we wanted an affordable place to live downtown. We were drawn to the idea of living in crazy old houses with a small market on the corner in a duplex with our best friends and we could hop The Rapid to get to class. You could say we fell in love with the city at that point. But that was 2004 and our neighborhood has changed a lot since then. In good ways for some, but poorly for others (in terms of diversity and gentrification).

All that we all want is safety, stores that ALL can enjoy, and the ability to bike and walk there from home. Why don't we have a bike share yet? ZipCars?

I'd love to see us take our own identity and do it right, but we have to undo a lot of infrastructure from decades of city-center abandonment and rebuilding.

Think about it: Chicago river. NYC harbor. San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge. Portland's bridges and boat rides to various areas of town. Jacksonville's iconic bridges (thanks, Limp Bizkit).

What did we do with our iconic river running through our center-city? We built a highway overtop it. The S-curve is so wide and so perspective-shifting that as someone who has lived here for 15 years, I often challenge myself when driving through that stretch to determine which side of the highway the river is actually on. Often times I couldn't even tell you. And I happen to work at the top floor of a 100 year old building that sits just 5 feet off of the curve.

Road transport accidents are a leading cause of death for children in the U.S. Importantly, a large proportion of families live within walking distance of schools – we should reduce their exposure (at least) for those trips where there is ‘no excuse’ to ‘put them in harm’s way’. In addition, one in five children in the U.S. are obese, due primarily to physical inactivity. Furthermore, child pick-up and drop-off have been identified in many areas as important contributors to congestion. Initiatives are thus needed to promote active travel to schools, thereby reducing mortality (and injury) and obesity rates in children, congestion, air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
Smartphone-based technology platforms should be developed to empower families to transfer school trips from cars to other modes. High-fidelity smartphone sensors and advances in artificial intelligence enable the automatic detection of travel mode. This provides the foundation to implement truly personalized interventions that provide real-time recommendations for people to drive less, while enabling them to arrive at their destinations even earlier (or at worst within a few minutes of their current choice). Pilot studies should be implemented across schools to test the potential of new technologies (that enable the provision of individually relevant information) to promote a meaningful and sustained shift in travel behavior.","69","1","5","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-07-10 03:39:28",,"2018-07-10 03:39:28","2018-07-24 15:48:24","2018-07-10 05:39:36",,,,"2018-07-10 03:39:28","2018-07-24 15:48:24","2018-07-26 16:12:39",,,"1","3","0","0","0","1","5","0","0","0","2018-07-24 15:48:24","2018-07-10 05:39:36",,,"2018-07-24 15:48:24","2018-07-26 16:12:39",,,"1","3","0","0","0"

Sure there are subtle differences in signs, but only civil engineers can actually tell what's what.

This is hazardous when pedestrians walk out into unsuspecting traffic or when a well intentioned driver stops suddenly for pedestrians in an improper place.  On the other hand, pedestrians used to crossing roads where cars can only stop at lights will confuse driver's in areas where cars are supposed to stop at any intersection creating delays. 
I know I have definitely made mistakes both as a pedestrian and as a driver because of not knowing what sort of road I was on and which set of rules applied. This problem is magnified as a visitor to Grand Rapids from a small town.
Unfortunately this is probably more of a state problem than a city problem,  but I think Grand Rapids would be a greatly benefit from improved crosswalk signs and road/pedestrian rule communication.
Similarly, it is not always obvious to biker/driver's where bikes are allowed or not. Are bikes pedestrians or vehicles? It seems to be a free for all.

They use an AI designed route with stops like busses but offer upcharge, location-based pickup and dropoff.

FAST
Smaller vehicles allow for more shuttles and more frequent pickups. They are more nimble in traffic and most importantly, they are synced with the traffic lights. They make stops during red lights and get green lights whenever they are moving. This could be done by matching their routes with the traffic light timing or by using AI to update the routes and lights simultaneously in real time to optimize both shuttle services and traffic flow.

CONVENIENT
Use the app to track the shuttle so you know EXACTLY when you need to be at a stop. -OR- Use location-based PICKUP or DROPOFF, similar to ridesharing services, for an upcharge. 

Every ride is automatically charged through the app and automatically discounted if you're a frequent rider. 

EVERY seat has a usb port.

Parking lots located near highway off-ramps, outside city limits, allow for more parking spaces and city visitors can easily board The Super.

AUTONOMY
This system would easily transition to autonomous vehicles. It's minimized operations radius would allow for more thorough 3D mapping, lower speed limits and potential use of sensors placed in intersections.","60","0","1","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-07-11 21:30:39","2018-07-11 21:41:55","2018-07-11 21:30:39",,"2018-07-11 23:09:43",,,"2018-07-11 21:44:35","2018-07-11 21:30:39",,"2018-07-11 23:09:43",,,"0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0",,"2018-07-11 23:09:43",,,,"2018-07-11 23:09:43",,,"0","1","0","0","0"

This means I need to plan ahead for the eventuality it will be full, by leaving earlier, being prepared to bike the entire trip, or being prepared to get on the bus without my bike. Sometimes when I am riding the bus and have my bike on the front, I'll see other people with bikes wanting to get on but not being able to because the racks are full. When that happens, I get off earlier if I'm pretty close to where I want to go so the other person can use the rack. It would be nice if the app that shows the ETA of the bus could also indicate if the bike racks are in use. 

Another issue I have with the bike racks is that I can't fit the tandem bike on the front. I have a son with autism; if we are travelling in a high traffic area, I'd rather have him on the back of the tandem bike with me rather than on his own separate bike, but when using the bus bike rack, we need to take separate bikes. 

Yesterday when we took our bikes on the bus, I got to my destination to find I had bike chain grease and a tire track on my pants, from when I loaded the bike onto the rack. Loading the bike is a minor struggle for me, and I think for some people it would be very difficult to do.

Suburban growth contributes to GR's ingrained dependency on one car per person. In fact, just 6% of workers downtown don't use a car to get to work (2). And suburbs don't stop changing. Whether driven by overall population growth/decline in Kent County or families moving into/out of the urban center- our suburbs will always see population fluctuation. And with that fluctuation, our public transport needs to be flexible to meet changing demands.

Advancing our public transportation will also be expensive. An example is the Silver Line, opened in 2014, running from 54th Street/South Division to downtown (about 10 miles) and cost around $35 million in public funds.  Projected to contribute $160 million in development, Division has seen little to no new investment. Projected to have 7,200 average weekday boarding's the service only saw 2,700 in the 2017 fiscal year (3). $35 million is a lot for a single inflexible bus line. Or Google the Qline in Detroit to see an expensive project having lower impact than expected.

GR needs better public transportation, but those options need to be dense (lots of options), efficient, and convenient to promote widespread usage. It also needs to be flexible to meet changing demands. Cars are just too convenient, especially in Grand Rapids where traffic (at least for now) isn't that bad.

There are so few remaining old buildings out there in the city center and so many of them have been taken down for various reasons - parking included. The new developments demand a pricetag with their commercial rental. And many times those developments aren't for passers by to enjoy, anyway. Entire blocks of downtown turn into concrete jungles where you're just passing through to reach something that you can actually enter as a shopper or diner, etc.

Not knocking the development that has been done, for that I am thankful in many ways as it's turned our city into one that is a success story post-recession. However, I do wish these mom and pop shops could still exist in harmony with what new is coming in. I just don't see where that can happen anymore as these properties disappear. And for us pedestrians, it means the walking paths become extended between those commercial districts separated by these office properties.

He argued that the city of Grand Rapids and Ellis has done a great job of taking single level parking lots and building them up and making them several stories adding the necessary and needed parking. I agree with that. But the argument that I hear repeatedly from service workers is that they can't afford to pay 16 18 or $24 a day to park. The architect told me he pays $100 a week to Park, well, not actually he pays $100 a week, the company he works for pays $100 a week. I asked him how many restaurants, hotels, bars or stores downtown do you think are paying for their service workers parking.

I just wonder what kind of potential these all in one apps could have for the future of transit in Grand Rapids.

I have  a winter beater mountain bike with knobby tires, fleece-lined wool gloves, and really warm boots, but no pricey equipment. The cold can be invigorating; the relative quiet and slower vehicle traffic when there's snow on the ground make biking restful, even. When it's slushy and gross, riding my bike means my feet don't get wet from walking. The times when it's a tough slog, it's a challenge that makes me feel good about myself when I'm done. I don't travel long distances by bike in the snow, but am up for trips of perhaps six miles or so round trip. I think, if more people tried it, they might find they enjoy it. The mindset that GR shouldn't invest in bicycle infrastructure because it can't be used during the colder months may be there because people haven't tried it.

It begins on Route 50 (future Laker Line BRT route) from GVSU-Allendale to Central Station in Downtown GR (50 minutes), then continues w/ a transfer there onto Route 6 to Woodland Station (45 minutes) and then a final transfer onto Route 17 from Woodland to Ford Airport Station (25 minutes).  

Were this route replaced with the conceptualized East-West Metrorail system, this trip would be cut in half to an hour, would avoid the vast amount of traffic stops/road obstructions that plague this heavily traveled corridor including its 9 college campuses with 45,000+ students, the 65,000+ workers of Downtown GR and the 2.8 million+ annual users of Ford Airport.

Additionally, the current bus mode for this corridor does not promote multiple stops at any of its 19 super-regional destinations due to each stop adding exorbitant amounts of additional wait times for the next bus that will predictably be caught in traffic/road obstructions.  The seamless intermodality of having a single metrorail transit spine with a bus system that ties into its station sites like feeder ribs will absolutely upgrade the attractiveness of GR as a key American metropolitan area in which its residents can live, work, learn and play with maximum access, choice and independence of mobility.  A demonstration asset is needed; STAY TUNED.","64","0","2","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-07-19 13:53:11","2018-07-19 14:04:40","2018-07-23 03:35:11",,"2018-07-23 04:35:09",,,"2018-07-23 03:35:11","2018-07-23 03:35:11",,"2018-07-23 14:51:32",,,"0","2","0","0","0","0","2","0","0","0",,"2018-07-23 04:35:09",,,,"2018-07-23 14:51:32",,,"0","2","0","0","0"

The Rapid Station would be an incredible location for a modest downtown Meijer, Trader Joe’s, D&W, Family Fare, or ALDI.  People could pick up ingredients for dinner on their commute home as they change bus lines.  They could grab a quick bite for breakfast on their way to work.  This would be profitable for the store and the Rapid as well as incredible convenient and an effective solution to the food desert downtown that makes it extremely difficult for lower-income people to access healthy food.","69","1","4","0","0","0","1","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-07-20 17:48:06",,"2018-07-20 17:48:06","2018-07-24 13:06:01","2018-07-20 18:13:57",,"2018-07-22 04:02:56",,"2018-07-20 17:48:06","2018-07-24 13:06:01","2018-07-24 12:59:31",,"2018-07-22 04:02:56","1","4","0","0","1","1","4","0","0","1","2018-07-24 13:06:01","2018-07-20 18:13:57",,"2018-07-22 04:02:56","2018-07-24 13:06:01","2018-07-24 12:59:31",,"2018-07-22 04:02:56","1","4","0","0","1"

Wireless positioning technology combined with open source hardware make it possible to implement a low-cost, peer-to-peer bike sharing network across the city.

Applied Research in Government Operations (ARGO) is proposing that Grand Rapids can implement and operate their own home-grown bike sharing network by developing a simple hardware kit and a simple mobile app to let Grand Rapids residents (Rapidians?, Rapidos?, Rapidites?) to share each other's bikes.

The hardware kit will include an electronic bike lock,  location sensing system, and bike generator  (for power) that sends the bike's location every 30 seconds.  A citizen can simply create an account on the mobile app and add details about their bike. Upon verification, the city sends them the hardware kit that they can install themselves and leave their bike out for the public to rent out.

Every month, the city analyzes trip data from bikes and pays owners.

A citizen who leases out their e-bike can make more money than a citizen who leases out a regular bike. 

A rider can simply open the app and check for bikes in their area. They can pay for the ride on the app which unlocks the bike for a specified period. After the reservation expires, the bike should be locked. Any violations are paid to the owner.

The city can receive a fixed % of each bike transaction.","83","1","7","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-07-21 17:21:06",,"2018-07-21 17:21:06","2018-07-22 09:26:25","2018-07-21 18:55:32",,,,"2018-07-21 17:21:06","2018-07-22 09:26:25","2018-07-22 23:31:50",,,"1","4","0","0","0","1","7","0","0","0","2018-07-22 09:26:25","2018-07-21 18:55:32",,,"2018-07-22 09:26:25","2018-07-22 23:31:50",,,"1","4","0","0","0"

Getting groceries home and carts returned is obviously a problem - and it's, in the end, a transportation problem. Carrying large bags of groceries home is difficult for people who don't drive a car, but it's also a problem for everyone: lost carts create extra expenses for stores, which are passed on to customers; they're an eyesore when left in inappropriate places; they block sidewalks (there's a spot near 28th and Eastern where this is a particular problem); and it hurts the environment when they end up being pushed into waterways. They're probably further downstream now, but until the flooding this past spring, there were two carts in Plaster Creek along the Ken-O-Sha trail. Not surprisingly, I've never seen an Aldi cart where it didn't belong, since Aldi charges a $.25 deposit on its carts. Ideally, there'd be a way to make it easy both for people to transport their groceries AND get the carts back where they belong.","40","0","4","0","0","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2018-07-22 04:02:56",,"2018-07-22 04:02:56",,"2018-07-22 15:40:14",,,,"2018-07-22 04:02:56",,"2018-07-23 13:58:05",,,"0","4","0","0","0","0","4","0","0","0",,"2018-07-22 15:40:14",,,,"2018-07-23 13:58:05",,,"0","4","0","0","0"
