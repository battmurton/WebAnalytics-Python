"free-trolleys-are-awsome","Hello James, what a great story! 
I am Matteo, one of the Facilitaros in the Miami Challenge. 
Let's dig a bit on your experience, how would you change the perception of free that you as a foreigner had? Do you think locals are having that problem too? 

Please contribute to this idea if you are a local having the same perception or a different one and could build on top of this post!",,"matteo2","Matteo","Cappelleti","matteo@100open.com","ADMIN","2018-06-13 14:53:37","2018-06-13 15:07:50","https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/free-trolleys-are-awsome/comments#!c-31fefc0e570cb3860f2a6d4b38c6490d"

"tell-us-a-time-when-you-felt-the-public-transport-worked","So I feel like public transportation DOES work but does it work well? The reason why Uber exists is because taxi companies provided limited access and control fares. Netflix exists because Blockbusters charges crazy fees. 

Point is is the metro system could use some innovation. I haven’t ridden a public bus in over a decade. Miami-Dade transit does not do logistics well and bus drivers are... not very friendly.

I personally would choose to walk (or even a jog depending on your situation and plans); it is more active for a person.

"expand-metrorail-now",,"Hi, Katie:
The East-West journey is terrible during the week.  It is only ten miles from my home in Kendall to my job in Coral Gables, yet it takes me anywhere between 1 and one and half hours (worse during the school months, slightly better in summer).  It shouldn't take that long.   I can remember when it took 20 minutes, but that was 30 years ago.  As houses continue to be built in the far western fringes of the county, the problem will only get worse.  I really do think sometimes about moving to north Florida.  I'm wasting far too much of my life sitting in traffic, and dealing with crazy drivers.  I have little confidence that the county will ever step up and do anything.  The 836 extension that they are proposing along the Urban Development Boundary is only going to make traffic worse -- then we're really going to see western development!     More subdivisions = more cars.","masebree","Michelle","Sebree","masebree@lfiplaw.com","USER","2018-06-13 20:04:03",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/expand-metrorail-now/comments#!c-bd686fd640be98efaae0091fa301e613"

Thank you for your reply.  It makes me depressed when I see all the money the county throws away on widening 826, 836, etc. when it all could have been used on sustainable mass transit that would have solved our traffic nightmare!  For some reason, the county seems to think that building and widening roads is the way to go, when it actually just creates the problem it is trying to solve.  I remember when Coral Way and Bird Road were widened to three lanes.  Did it lessen traffic?  Unfortunately, no.  It just meant a wider road with even more traffic!

Thank you for the link -- Coral Gables is actually doing this now, and it seems to be working!  Unfortunately, Dade County is not as progressive.  They really seem to think that the answer is to build more roads.  Right now, the Mayor is actively pushing a western extension to the existing 836 expressway, which will cut through endangered wetlands.  There is  no way this will reduce traffic, rather, it will just encourage more western development (i.e. more traffic).  The Mayor doesn't understand this.  The issue is being heard by the County Commission on June 20.

I'm no expert, but from everything I have read and or heard... MDT ridership is declining because of a few reasons

It's a nice approach, but if you only ban certain plates and not the drivers themselves, it starts to disproportionally affect more vulnerable communities. Families with means are able to purchase multiple cars with different plates which would therefore bypass the law. On the other hand, there are families which share one car to go to work, school, and errands. They'd have to rely on either an extremely poor public transportation infrastructure or face the fines which would further strain the family. 

Although, I  do believe it could be a viable option for the Downtown/Brickell Area once the public transportation infrastructure in that area is brought up to a higher capacity.",,"amml1994","Antonio","Monsalve","amml1994@yahoo.com","USER","2018-06-14 02:37:23",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/pick-a-plate-it-will-help-control-traffic-during-peaks-hours-they-can-t-drive-during-certain-times-of-days/comments#!c-9b04d152845ec0a378394003c96da594"

"dynamic-and-flexible-carpool-solution","Hi Matteo, thanks for note.

Based on research more than 70% of commuters drive alone to work everyday and this not only causes an overwhelming amount of congestion on the road during peak hours, but it also adds to parking problems.  

We've found that there are a few reasons why more people don't carpool. First, it is tough to find someone with the same commute schedule and on the same rout the same route to work. Second, most people just don't know what time they want to go home when they get to work in the morning.  This makes it hard to commit to a long-term &quot;traditional&quot; carpool.",,"jay","Jay","Jobanputra","jay@takescoop.com","USER","2018-06-15 01:13:16",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/dynamic-and-flexible-carpool-solution/comments#!c-950a4152c2b4aa3ad78bdd6b366cc179"

Florida is known to have one of the best roads in the country. Most of that is due to the ability to self fund projects. About 30% is really federal funds. Everything else is local and state taxes. Tolls also go to SunPass (Turnpike) which is a semi private enterprise. FDOT and local agencies don’t really  get much out of tolls either. So why is it that it costs $6 to go one way on the Dolphin expressway when people need to use it everyday? 95 express lanes can go up to $15, one way.","saramos006","Stephanie","Ann","saramos006@gmail.com","USER","2018-06-14 15:40:52",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/traffic-improvement-of-miami-dade-county/comments#!c-db8e1af0cb3aca1ae2d0018624204529"

The government is too busy building pointless express lanes that take away from the existing right of way. These new roads are taken away from current highways, reducing the lanes for travelers.

If everyone just drove at mid speed and steadily you'd all get where you are going faster in the end. 
Anyway - I'm going to point out the obvious now, if you ban senior citizens from driving I hope you have a great network of trains and busses by the time you are old, or you won't be getting out much.

"old-people","Hi Omar, Katie, Matteo,  I share Omar's frustration with slow drivers who block traffic behind them.  Often it seems they are older people who may have vision problems, be lost, or have other issues.  I personally try to drive at the speed limit and sometimes above when traffic is flowing fast as it often does on our local thoroughfares.  When I am in a residential neighborhood I try to be aware that a child or pet may dart into the street and adjust my speed accordingly.  Oftentimes pedestrians stroll across a busy street without a glance, assuming that vehicles will yield for them (sometimes with tragic results).  I think it all comes down to patience and consideration for those who share the roads with us, allowing faster traffic to pass, not crowding people who are trying to watch for street or exit signs.",,"christz","Lawrence","Steinmetz","christz@bellsouth.net","USER","2018-06-15 16:09:25",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/old-people/comments#!c-fb7b9ffa5462084c5f4e7e85a093e6d7"

Great ideas! Great usage of images and graphs! Congrats on a great post!
Your observation is that Traffic is work related, really focused on fixed times right?
The commuting time is also another one and the short amount of remote jobs that affect directly the car traffic.
Let's try going a level deeper on those idea, why are these like this? what is your experience on these?
Let's focus on the phase we are in, the exploration phase, we will get to the idea solution phase later, we need to see what are the main concerns, observations and experiences we are having now in the city in our daily commute or mobility space.

Great observation, let's focus on the problem here, &quot;A majority of the time, these traffic jams are caused by Uber and Lyft Drivers who feel they have the right to stop in the middle of the road to search for their pick up and stall a majority of other vehicles who need to get to their destination whether its home or work&quot; .L
et's go a little deeper here because you have a great problem, In order for us to build a better solution you have to really understand all the players involved to ensure your solution fits both sides of the spectrum, I suggest you ask for an uber/lyft ride and ask one of the drivers their experience, so they can tell you why are they doing this and how did they get to that way of behaving. You are covering the other side spectrum as you are the other driver.

"specially-designated-spots-for-uber-and-lyft-drivers",,"Thank You for answering Matteo,

While I do drive, there have been moments where in order to save money I have used Uber services usually when going to and from the airport or to the downtown metropolitan area. Just yesterday I decided to use uber to go to downtown, during the trip I spoke to the driver regarding this and he voiced his opinion in that most drivers believe they are entitled to stop in the middle of the streets to pick up clientele due to user ratings and reviews. In their eyes, they believe that if they go fast enough to pick up clients, at the cost of stalling traffic, they will receive better reviews by their client even thou half the time most people do not leave reviews because it takes time out of what their doing or they just plain forget. At the same time, the driver expressed how some clients will pace up and down the sidewalk causing the driver to drive very slowly in search for the client which causes traffic to slow down and makes the driver nervous because he knows he's holding up traffic and since there are no parking spots for him to stop, he's forced to drive until he finds the client. It comes down to whether or not the driver cares if they're disrupting traffic and if they do care, being forced to drive slowly due to not having any available spaces for them to park and wait for clients . I understand the importance of good customer  service especially in today's world but when its at the cost of the people around you, it starts to become a slight problem and even then there are those that do care but because of circumstances (example: not having a space to park and wait for clients) they're become forced to and have to take on irate individuals when its not even their fault, it's a very double-edged sword dilemma in that most do not care but at the same time some do care but are forced to due to circumstances. By giving special spots for drivers to stop and pick up clients, drivers won't have to stand in the middle of the street to pick up clients and cause stalls while at the same time clients will have an easier time finding their driving by simply  going to the Uber stop on the street or just waiting at the stop for their driver. This will also assist Uber Eats delivery personnel since they need to wait for food to be prepared which can take from minutes to even hours  and with the use of the parking spots, they can wait without the worry of on-coming traffic.","noelmendez82","Noel","Mendez","noelmendez82@gmail.com","USER","2018-06-17 19:21:37","2018-06-18 23:49:44","https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/specially-designated-spots-for-uber-and-lyft-drivers/comments#!c-d18f655c3fce66ca401d5f38b48c89af"

This is true: 
&quot;It comes down to whether or not the driver cares if they're disrupting traffic and if they do care, being forced to drive slowly due to not having any available spaces for them to park and wait for clients&quot; but there is a deeper issue behind this. would you say it is driver's education? pedestrian's education? just plain empathy?

"specially-designated-spots-for-uber-and-lyft-drivers",,"Thanks for replying Matteo,

It comes down to all three, the empathy of the driver, driver's education and the pedestrian's education. Since it's the driver who has to pick up client, they usually have to make a choice between disrupting traffic by stopping in the middle of the street in order to pick up their client quickly thus causing drivers to become irate just because the driver wanted to make a speedy pick up or the other choice being aligning themselves in parking space (if one is available at the time) for the driver to wait for their client to arrive be picked up. 99% of the time, latter is never an option since most Uber and Lyft drivers work in downtown metropolitan areas where parking slim and few and traffic is at a high, so its a very serious dilemma for the driver. It also has to be taken into account the driver's background before they became a driver associated with either Uber or Lyft, this can go all the way back to how they were raised by their families with the teachings of basic moral values and general respect for fellow drivers on the road however the promise of monetary payment tends to twist those values to a degree where drivers will do what it takes to make quick and easy money at the cost of others. Other times, drivers may have set morals but due to issues occurring at the time, it may cause them to do things they wouldn't do as drivers these situations can be caused by financial pressures and other varying causes such as taking care of children or trying to balance between multiple jobs alongside Uber in order to make a decent living, they're force to put their ethical standards to the side because of these situations even though its uncomfortable for the driver, they're not left many viable options. The pedestrian's ethical standing and education may also be put into play since they are the ones that pay the driver for the service and at the end give feedback on the driver's performance. Most often then not, pedestrian's will forget to give the driver any sort of positive or just general feedback through the Uber or Lyft applications and only remember to give feedback only when they have a negative experience. In my eyes, its important to give credit where is credit is earned and that means leaving good feedback and tipping the driver for an excellent drive because that is how I was raised by my family but with this fast paced, 100 miles per hour world we live in, most people are more pre-occupied with getting to where they have to go without giving thanks to the people who got them there in the first place. That is not to say that there aren't people who have a sense of ethical understanding, its just that the margin of people who do are very slim to none since most of society bases themselves on instant gratification and entitlement coupled with a &quot;Me, Myself, and I&quot; mentality could be the root of most problems.

"how-to-minimize-traffic-in-miami","Hello my name is Daniel Oneill . I am 29 year old elevator mechanic . I live in broward but work in Miami . For the past 10 years I have studied traffic patterns on i95 northbound from downtown Miami all the way into broward during rush hour .  What I have found is that the right two lanes uasually tend to allow traffic to flow more than the left 2 lanes . I believe this is due to exit lanes where exiting motorists clear a path for people behind them . Also I believe this is due to the “rushers “ always trying to get in the “fast lanes”  or left two lanes .  The only times I see the right lanes obstructed is when a  lane merger  occurs  or when motorists merge into traffic from an exit only lane cutting other off at the last possible second to get from the exit only back into traffic .  I strongly believe that  if one or two  lanes were added to the right (only possible side ) and exit only lanes were removed there would be less people cutting others off at the end of those lanes .  This would cause less sudden stopping thus allowing easier flow of traffic . Even if I do not win this contest (because this is all pretty obvious ) I would not mind working with Miami Dade county  by documenting different lane speeds at different times of the day . I have always wanted to do that to determine the fastest route home via i95 .  I hope someone can figure this problem out Because I know for a fact an easier drive will reduce stress and road rage . In turn this has a direct effect on reducing accidents , road rage , traffic our community’s  wellbeing .",,"joker07954","Dan","Man","joker07954@aim.com","USER","2018-06-14 13:18:25",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/how-to-minimize-traffic-in-miami/comments#!c-cfa0860e83a4c3a763a7e62d825349f7"

"shared-rides-higher-hov-lanes-ratio-delivery-services-and-enforcement","Thank you for your comment Katie,
There is a working operation in California (Silicon Valley to be exact) where auto-driving robot is delivering your grocery shopping. http://bgr.com/2017/01/31/robot-delivery-pizza-starship-technologies/
Think of most of your errands today - you spend hours a week on the road picking and delivering goods, looking for parking, slowing down traffic. Even if you used the service of a scooter delivery person, taking way less space, less pollution, etc... there are models like that in most cities in the world, who well fought traffic. Even doing something like closing parking lots, which seems like unrealistic, can lead people who work in certain congested areas to prefer public transportation or drop-off shared riding like Uber and Taxis, because they just can't park. Now let's examine the effect of it - if I needed to use my car to go to work and another person did. That's 2 vehicles riding in the same direction and being left for 8 hours on the side of a street or occupying a parking lot, which could serve for living, not for storing a transportation solution... now do we need Gas? Are we making some stops? Accidents? Pollution? All of that is a thing of the past if we could just share a ride. The big trouble is - we can't step out of the house and into the office door like we do when we use our vehicle, because nobody will provide the same solution, however, if we have the app to connect the points, similar to Uber, allowing many businesses who're proud of being &quot;green&quot; to collaborate in this new method, adding some taxes to others who are still operating vehicles the old fashioned way by driving themselves during rush hours, then we can resolve traffic. As a car manufacturer - Ford can make itself very efficient by investing in automation - the solutions are out there but people are afraid of public adaptation - by collaborating with the city of Miami - you have the power to bring taxes to those who don't adopt, so you can sponsor public awareness and your own brand.",,"yanivfel","Yaniv","Feldman","yanivfel@gmail.com","USER","2018-06-14 19:23:29",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/shared-rides-higher-hov-lanes-ratio-delivery-services-and-enforcement/comments#!c-918317b57931b6b7a7d29490fe5ec9f9"

"bus-only-lanes-on-all-main-road",,"This is very hard. The haphazard aspect is inextricably linked to migrated &amp; moved &amp; segregated races. Miami's been home to indians, whites, blacks, &amp; now hispanics, especially cubans, as myself. We need to connect the east northwest or as we racistly say in spanish, &quot;the black neighborhood&quot; to the beach 1 &amp; 2 the southwest (where there's another ghetto &quot;Homestead&quot;). Now, the other thing is the good/better metro mobility in the east northwest  &amp; coral gables &amp; the lack of metro in the west &amp; west west &amp; southwest. This is silly. Now, Miami has a chance to change, because we are not Broward, not racist, not rednecks. We simply need 1 to incorporate unincorporated areas, 2 to prioritize the unconnected southwest thru *treating* the topics--traffic &amp; mobility &amp; urban woes, especially the lack of density or even  of incorporating as taxing towns or neighborhoods--3 fix the issue with bus-only lanes &amp; a metro extended to homestead . Now the funny thing is that where the metro is to be extended is now one of the few bus only roads. Now the issue of narrow roads varies. For example, I looked at biscayne blvrd, a weighty thorofare, &amp; it is too narrow. That is a fundamental issue. Also, Coral Way goes too thus in Coral Gables thru residential street, so similar. Narrow streets dont allow for bus-lanes &amp; because of the underdevelopment (urban decay), &amp; of lack of incorporating or because of slack gov, these simply underperfom 1 clogged by whoever doesnt know to walk or cycle, 2  with more accidents, 3 without needful space , 4.... etc, but other streets, however, *are* broad enuf wherein we can take one lane for a bus alone *but* in the beginning you can have issues. We have to look at the bus not as a crowded, poor people country club, but as *the* essential public investment in a socially responsible relation with the road, because 1 Toyota is miles away in its Island Utopia (Japan) (even Chrysler &amp; Dodge make money for a rich foreigner Italy &quot;Fiat&quot;) 2 Miami can live in racial harmony if we look beyond the middle class americanisms we as hispanics have appropriated &amp; 3 the urban heat island effect creates an oppressive environment for everybody &amp; the more metal, &amp; parking lots, the worse.","bueyberde","Yoandri","Dominguez Garcia","bueyberde@gmail.com","USER","2018-06-18 08:03:32","2018-06-18 08:27:00","https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/bus-only-lanes-on-all-main-road/comments#!c-35051070e572e47d2c26c241ab88307f"
"bus-only-lanes-on-all-main-road",,"Once again you’ve shown your propensity to tackle the elephant in the room. Many themes here <Ubueyberde><Yoandri Dominguez Garcia>&nbsp;

From the outside, Miami seems like the tropical paradise turned business haven. You wouldn’t know it from the pretty ads but upon a closer look, Miami is extremely divided. Beyond just haves and have nots, our Southern magical city is full of political tension and cultural clashes. 

Check out this 2013 quote from CityLab discussing class-divide in major cities, Miami’s their 6th installment of a series: “This class divide is overlaid by a long-standing racial divide and also by the cleavage between &uuml;ber-affluent part-time residents, wealthy tourists and far less advantaged locals who overwhelmingly work in the service industry. As a global city, Miami also bears the stamp of two distinct immigrations — the influx of wealthy Latin Americans, Europeans, Russians, and others who are part of the global one percent, and the much larger group of low-wage, low-skill immigrants from across Latin America who toil in low-wage service and blue-collar jobs far field from its more privileged enclaves.” Link: https://www.citylab.com/equity/2013/03/class-divided-cities-miami-edition/4678/ It is worthy of a deep read as it covers geographic, racial and wealth divides which tie into our many issues, one of them transportation and mobility. It also has maps which cover ALL the municipalities which you mentioned. Miami Gardens and North Miami still have many part of their municipalities that remain largely unincorporated. I don’t know how residents of Perrine, Homestead get around without a car. Still very large masses of land that are less dense than Greater Miami. How does this affect mobility and public transportation for those residents? 

If you want to be at the forefront of innovation in mobility in a city like Miami, it will take the efforts of organizations such as BlackTech Week and Catalyst Miami which both focus on underrepresented individuals, through different acts of civility and innovation along with  city officials NOT JUST city planners.  

Looking forward to seeing where you ideas go.

"bus-only-lanes-on-all-main-road","Hi <Ubueyberde><Yoandri Dominguez Garcia>&nbsp;, 

I'm Wilda, one of the community facilitators here. Thanks for your insightful post. I find it refreshing. I never though of a metro service being different from what we have here. I've been both to Atlanta (MARTA) and NYC (NYCTA) and in terms of public transportation, Miami-Dade misses the mark on several factors. 1)  consistency: Riders are leaving Miami-Dade transit in a mass exodus.  http://www.miamitodaynews.com/2017/12/26/miami-dade-transit-takes-worst-plunge-use-ever/ Check out the first comment! 

Now I'm not sure how they'd operate during the same hours because more rural areas won't need to operate at the same level as more metro areas. Perhaps you're on to something when you say only 1 bus per road. For example: Why does the 3, 16 and the (Biscayne) MAX ALL run on the same Biscayne road? See the MDT map here: https://www.miamidade.gov/transit/library/system-maps-web.pdf 

Have you seen what Downtown Miami's streets look like lately? They're &quot;COMPLETED STREETS&quot;  project is refreshing. They've really done an amazing job with bus-only lane. See The New Tropic editorial here: https://thenewtropic.com/downtown-miami-complete-streets/

"bus-only-lanes-on-all-main-road","Hi! It is worrisome but the first comment is interesting. I actually get a huge kick out of 'have a nice day' said not just to bus drivers but other workers, *because it is not easy to work &amp; i appreciate whenever.* Now, even with Homestead as a 'rural' place, we benefit from traffic to natural areas: everglades &amp; biscayne bay, national parks btw.  That ties into the Downtown Miami thing you linked--we need to connect the county not just Miami, because our best resources are the national parks, not downtown nor miami beach. Miami Beach is already spent &amp; outworn as a marketable tourist trap.

"bus-only-lanes-on-all-main-road","Hi again! I think that there is a pattern here. You see, these richer neighborhoods tend to have a fancy mall. Doral Dolphin Mall, Kendall The Falls, Dadeland Dadeland, Sunset Sunset, Coconut Grove Cocowalk, Aventura Aventura, etc. So, to tie it to mobility, we can simply prioritize speedy access to these malls &amp; reduce the parking lots. Parking lots serve only the locals &amp; the workers. This is an unsightly waste. Many workers can simply go on bus, as many poorer others do. The tourists generally dont rent cars, but take taxis, shuttles, etc.  If you reduce the parking lots, then you have space for communal areas of various designs, not unchanging scorching asphalt.",,"bueyberde","Yoandri","Dominguez Garcia","bueyberde@gmail.com","USER","2018-06-23 18:42:10","2018-06-23 18:43:35","https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/bus-only-lanes-on-all-main-road/comments#!c-b2f627fff19fda463cb386442eac2b3d"

"use-existing-technology-develop-for-the-future-not-yesterday-think-outside-the-box","Hello Katie,
You are correct, the Everglades are a great resource for tourism for South Florida and yes there should be skepticism for damage to this resource; but I believe this could be done in a way that it does not destroy our back yard. My simple picture does not show what I envision but I will try and paint a better picture for you. I truly enjoy watching the show modern marvels and from what I've seen from around the world when something has to be done, then great minds come together and solutions are made. My vision of this superhighway thru the protected area's of the Everglades would be built on and elevate platform. This platform only need be as high as the current Metrorail platform. Short term damage from construction will happen, but with proper oversight and managed / disciplined building practices I believe we will be able to achieve a great end result. The rail stops will entail taking a shuttle from the feeder road station to the rail platform. The platform footprint will be much smaller and the parking structure would be kept outside of the Everglades protected area. I believe that these structures can be built in an ergonomic way as to not take away from our natural resource. This is a bold idea and it is thinking outside of the box, but so were Walt Disney thoughts when he decided to build Disney World.

Driving to work has also been very difficult in Miami  and I have noticed a few things that make it all the more difficult and that's what I tried fixing. 

1. Highways are extremely congested.  Us-1, i-95, 837, 827, etc.
2. The busses and trucks trying to manuever around in the small City streets slow down the rest of traffic by a lot. 
3. From my experience, a very small amount of people currently use the public transportation for their daily commute or any form of carpooling and I believe if it were convenient enough, quick, not too much walking and especially if their were specific incentives, such as special public transportation Lanes on the highways - say during rush hour in place of say HOV Lanes - their really can be an significant increase in users.","arekatzman","Ari","Katzman","arekatzman@gmail.com","USER","2018-06-25 21:15:14",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/take-uber-express-to-the-next-level/comments#!c-291597a100aadd814d197af4f4bab3a7"

Thanks for posting and sharing your experience! I am Matteo, one of the facilitator's here.
So you are saying that the main problem that you idenfitied is that the public transportation routes are too short, and they could be expanded. The second problem for you is there aren't enough bus routes/times, nor FREE services to promote our city. To build on that last problem, I see you are observing that there could be a way to use the promotion of the city as a key aspect to base the services on , how about something like this:

"md-traffic-saving-program-app",,"Somewhere in our minds we have been planted a fear of sharing with others. I think I can imagine the human nature, individualistic and selfish, embracing the idea that there’s no sense in taking a risk sharing the responsibility of someone else riding us if we have our own means of transportation. Not only is lack of confidence in the ability of another driver but also lack of desire because it’s a situation that I can solve by myself without risking. Think the idea is to consolidate this around our place of employment because we spent as average 35 hours a week working and within our employment period of life that’s almost the half of the time we are not sleeping. So, we create friendship in our place of work,  you can know that partner very well, you know that he does not use drugs, you may know he is a responsible person, you know that during the trip you are not with a stranger. We could try more this subject in television, we could make more effort in an aggressive telemarketing regarding the advantages of saving our fuel and the depreciation of our vehicle if someone else from work is able to ride us. There’s important references from other states, this is an article from June 2009 Profiles of Innovative Rural Vanpool Programs: “Among the nation’s most innovative vanpool programs are the ones operating in Washington State. This is due, in part, to the enactment of two key pieces of state legislation. In 1991, Washington incorporated the Commute Trip Reduction Law into its Clean Air Act. The law requires each county with a residential population of more than 150,000 and employers with more than 100 employees, as well as each city within those counties containing a major employer with more than 100 employees who must travel during the peak hours of 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m., to follow certain mandates. The guidelines stipulate that employers meeting these criteria must have an employee transportation coordinator on site, survey employees biennially and provide options to reduce single-occupant commuting; these options may include the 132(f) transit benefit and priority parking for vanpoolers and carpoolers. Following are examples of successful vanpool programs serving rural communities or commuters that have incorporated creative approaches to meeting the needs of both providers and participants. Among the elements leading to success are: • developing innovative partnerships; • reaching out to and involving area employers; • understanding the unique needs of individual communities; • obtaining strong political support from local leaders; • emphasizing ease of use for businesses by, for example, working with reliable, experienced third-party operators; • emphasizing ease of use for commuters; and • ensuring access to a guaranteed ride home.” In another hand we have a serious approach to the linking between ride assistance and tax saving chances with WageWorks. They have the Commuter Card. Employees can use this card just like a debit card where they pay for transit and parking. Employees decide how much money to load onto their cards, and that money is available for use on the same day as the payroll cycle. Smart Cards. WageWorks Commuter Account contributions are loaded directly onto transit agency smart cards where available. Buy My Pass. Employees identify which transit agency or vanpool provider to buy from, and the pass is delivered to their home. Pay My Provider. Employees can access their accounts online and fill out a simple form to pay transit agencies or parking providers–no receipts or claims forms required. Pay Me Back. Employees can arrange for commuter account funds to be deposited directly to a checking account or a check to be mailed to reimburse them for expenses they’ve already paid.

Distracted driving is another issue all it’s own.  Couldn’t drivers just tell officers they were using the phone for directions? We are becoming increasingly connected and rely on our devices for work and getting things done.

"improve-the-flow-of-vehicles-in-miami-dade-county",,"Those questions are easy to answer.
I explain:
In the case of the couple, they must coordinate their time, one to transport the other to their place of work. The effort should be everyone's.
For the case of nurses: There are professions that will have a &quot;special permit&quot; that will be half the time to use. That is, leave your vehicle half the time, that a person with normal work, is assigned. It is important that no one should feel favored with this measure. The effort belongs to everyone.
There are famous examples in Colombia, Brazil, Peru, and Venezuela. In Colombia and Peru its implementation is successful, but in Brazil and Venezuela it did not work, due to the corruption of the police that received money, when stopping a vehicle that was forbidden to drive that day.
In my house, we decided to use only one vehicle to take my wife's work and mine. We take turns depending on the demands and procedures of the day, and it has worked well. We have saved more than 40% in fuel per month (and there is no measure that obliges us). We talk more, and taking another to his work becomes more pleasant.
The public transport service is very good, but it could be improved (to support a measure like this), by increasing the number of units, and adding more transport circuits, to existing ones.
There are many details that surround such a measure, but the detailed planning of each aspect would result in a solid measure that would help improve traffic in the county.

"empower-the-work-force",,"Hi Katie, pleasure to meet you as well.  Remote working does happen in Miami and some companies do allow it but not enough.   A recent article written by Brian de HaaffCo-founder and CEO, Aha!@bdehaaff for Inc Magazine, sums it up best Titled &quot;Remote Workers Are Outperforming Office Workers--Here's Why&quot; 

Brian touches on three main reasons why the remote worker outperforms the office worker. 

1. Productivity
2. Team work 
3. Presence 

I believe Brian is very on point where he describes a greater concentration by being at home without office distractions and bringing a better teamwork environment as being distant requires better communication with peers and always showing up as remote workers do not call out sick. 

Now you take all of Brian's points as the benefits of the remote worker and throw in not having to commute and add traffic to a metro city and you have a solution to our current traffic problem. 

If companies can adopt a culture of less micro managing and encourage and empower the  remote worker it could solve a lot more that traffic.

"bikes-and-the-bike-train-system",,"Hi Katie. I used to live in south Florida so I’m very familiar with the nightmare that is Miami. My experience is that it would be possible for Miami if they focused on building safe protected bicycle infrastructure in order to get people biking and building more rail. The expansion of the Brightline and Tri-Rail into downtown is the start of the train system interacting with the Metrorail. The metrorail needs further expansion. It only has two lines in its entire history. By building that linear Underline Park under the metrorail they are creating one piece of the accessibility puzzle but it only works for people who live along US1. What you have happening instead is no clear transit accessibility that uncongests the traffic gridlock from Kendall and west to the east and back. You have no connection to Miami Beach. Then they wonder why the traffic keeps getting worse as they keep expanding roads and more cars come to fill up those roads, affectionately known as induced demand. When you build for cars you get cars. The opposite exists in Amsterdam as they take away space for cars. Thousands of people come in and out of the city everyday for work or whatever and they all do it without cars. It’s because the train provides the long distance connection that makes the bicycle an attractive local connection that enables the same door to door accessibility that made cars attractive. This is what needs to swap in Miami.","margarita","Margarita","Yerastova","margarita@yerastova.com","USER","2018-06-15 09:32:55",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/bikes-and-the-bike-train-system/comments#!c-58238e9ae2dd305d79c2ebc8c1883422"

"bikes-and-the-bike-train-system",,"It’s important to also note that bicycles perform the best between 1-5km of distance. They are great at local connections rather than distance. For this reason the train provides that extension of easy and convenient travel. Then the train stations have to be spaced appropriately in order to accommodate this accessibility and take away the incentive for people to drive to the station and expect free parking. Metrorail provides that connection to the regional commuter Tri-Rail making it the first access point on a bike-train system in Miami. But safe accessibility for bicycles to the train stations is the huge hurdle. Unless you live very close by, cycling to the station for the risk averse makes it a non starter.","margarita","Margarita","Yerastova","margarita@yerastova.com","USER","2018-06-15 10:22:47",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/bikes-and-the-bike-train-system/comments#!c-b3967a0e938dc2a6340e258630febd5a"

"bikes-and-the-bike-train-system",,"Well Miami is made up of various cities and they are all interconnected. The City of Miami itself has a population estimate of 453,579 with a density of 12,604.32/sq mi (4,866.49/km2) which is interesting because its closer to Amsterdam's actually. Miami-Dade County is roughly 2,751,796 with a density of 1,449.8/sq mi (559.8/km2), with the Miami Metro Area coming in at 6,158,824 (Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties). Amsterdam has 851,573 in the municipality itself, with a density of 5,135/km2 (13,300/sq mi). The urban area has 1,351,587, the Metro region 2,431,000, and the entire Randstad is 8,116,000 (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht). Miami only as a city has an area of 56.06 sq mi (145.20 km2) but this isn't combined with other cities like Kendall, Hialeah, Opa Locka, etc. and the Amsterdam city area has 219.32 km2 (84.68 sq mi). Altogether Miami-Dade County has 2,431 sq mi (6,296 km2). The Randstad has an area of 3,043 km2 (1,175 sq mi) and the Miami Metro region has 6,137 sq mi (15,890 km2). All of this can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami  and  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami-Dade_County,_Florida and this website by Arcadis also shows interesting statistics between Amsterdam and Miami that you have to click through https://www.arcadis.com/en/global/our-perspectives/sustainable-cities-mobility-index-2017/comparing-cities/?tf=tab-people&amp;sf=uptake_of_active_commuting&amp;r=all&amp;c=amsterdam,miami

Both cities are also very humid and rainy, with Miami averaging 132 rainy days and Amsterdam 182 (https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-Rainy-days,Amsterdam,Netherlands). The rain doesn't stop the Dutch from cycling. Of course heat is a problem in Miami, but that isn't something some proper shade can't address. Seville, Spain has temperatures that often exceed Miami's and they have a healthy cycling culture because they built the infrastructure that allowed a culture to take root, rather than being relegated to a fringe culture.

Amsterdam and Miami are both flat, both concerned with sea level rise, and both populous. Actually Miami seems to be less concerned, otherwise they wouldn't be building high-rises still with projections of going underwater. They had Dutch water officials come to try to help them but it seems to be a moot point. Miami's pattern of development mirror the rest of Florida = favoring developers who want cheap land, therefore less encouragement of infill and greater distances, fueling the autodependency. Amsterdam's patterns of development are the opposite, favoring local clustering, density, and short trips. That's why bike-train connections can help Miami to bridge that distance gap and let go of autodependency. They need to just focus on building extensive transit and protected cycling infrastructure in lieu of continuing the same trend of adding asphalt. However they are usually more interested in technomanagerial solutions to their mobility problems, like autonomous vehicles which are still just vehicles.","margarita","Margarita","Yerastova","margarita@yerastova.com","USER","2018-06-15 14:50:13","2018-06-15 15:05:33","https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/bikes-and-the-bike-train-system/comments#!c-0bb4aec1710521c12ee76289d9440817"

"to-provide-i-must-sacrifice",,"Hello Katie, yes that is an option that has been available to me. Being able to work at home has its pros but nothing in my opinion beats working from the office because of the access to everyone in your company and the resources available on site. Even if a portion of people happened to work from home to lower the traffic that still does not solve the problem. Traffic congestion begins at 7:30 am till 10 Am and 4pm to 8pm Monday through Friday. the lack of accessible roads, clogged streets and highways cause a trickle down affect to also our local roads. most of our roads are bottle necked even if you want to make a simple commute across the city during those times. It doesn't help either that the highways are always under constant repairs and renovations. I believe increasing the amount of lanes on the highways will loosen up traffic flow and also will decrease the snails pace people deal with as the exit lanes clear as the light lets people off to their destination. Realistically the issues probably lays in poor city planning or better yet the city outgrowing its original road ways. Renovating of roadways and proper maintenance will allow a better commute for most travelers. Also more 'Smart&quot; traffic lights that monitor traffic flow would help manage time management. If the lights are more synced and integrated with real time traffic updates that would help facilitate the movement through the county and all of South Florida.

I don’t see why county or state legislators would not back this especially with all these companies in this city of tomorrow program - it is for the betterment of its citizens. Really I don’t know how else we can weed out drivers (the ones who should not be on the road) some sort of authority is needed for this to work. Everyone needs to renew their licenses either due to changes of address, name, expired, or as I said before when they tell you for eye examination.It would be at this time to let licensed driver come and do driving exam. my idea really is a fix but it needs to be a complete top to bottom (government involvement) to actually work.  Our community should welcome such standards because it is an attempt to make our roads safe. We need educated people behind the wheel and in any structural setting of learning needs an authoritative presence to follow thru otherwise no one will care. That is one thing that has been lost in our city is caring for others (we are too caught up in our own lives to even consider someone else’s shoes) hence why we need a law or something for citizens to commit otherwise be held accountable.","christopher.corredor","Christopher","Corredor","christopher.corredor@gmail.com","USER","2018-06-17 02:47:44",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/mandate-driving-test-every-4-years/comments#!c-d07e70efcfab08731a97e7b91be644de"

"what-other-cities-do-well-that-we-can-implement","I have survey for years what works and not. I've watched and compared. I would implement something like the German system similar to the Autobahn. All tractor trailers in only one lane and medium trucks in another and cars in one and emergency vehicles in other lanes and no more mixing all these vehicles in traffic. The bus routes are useless and should have a landing loop to not affect flowing traffic when buses pull over to drop/pick up passengers. You can have districts or pods to divide certain functions for that part of the city only or distribution centers for trucks. All trains should be on outter city limits and have specific shuttles from to and back to these public stations i.e., Train, Ship, airplane.. And all ways keep a designated road for all evacuations. The tolls should be paid as tokens different prices for different circulation of travel and limit areas of travel within one mile and have pod parking for the north, south, east and west of different pods in the city. Give tax breaks when we use public pods. The signs on the highways and road ways should all changed to show arrows to say your heading to east pod and then the district is changed into divisions by color...the entire state of florida has all green signs with white letters. I've witness one car going 45mph and a truck going 50 and then another car going 65 and it causes imbalance of speed and flow of traffic..we need to reduce the traffic lights to sectors of the pods within the city area. Once you have all the trucks in one distribution pod then the cars will flow in their lanes at easier commute.

Great post, it seems that helping out special needs travelers is important with regard to improving their daily commutes, and for making transit more efficient for everybody.

"give-back",,"Hello, my pleasure.....My vehicle has a back up camera and can sense when someone or something comes too close when I am backing up. It can sense a hazard approaching from the front as well. It has heightend my awareness for any hazards that could arise around me; It is another set of eyes in a sense. We have a lot of older cars on the roads in Miami &amp; they are not as reliable or safe like the newer cars. I have seen tires blow out on 18 wheelers and a car swerve out of the way only to get rear ended by the driver of a car in another lane who did not have enough reaction time to brake sufficiently to avoid the collision. While driving, hazards can surface at any time. If the driver who rear ended the driver in front of them, because of the sudden swerve into their lane had automatic brake feature built into there vehicle, or a buzzer that went off to brake, they may have been able to avoid such heavy collision or collision all together. The roads of miami have been there for decades. We have express lanes, and they have increased the size of highways and repaved some of the roads which needed repavement. The palmetto is a highway which is always backed up because road work is being done to it. Even with Traffic moving at a slow pace people still manage to get distacted and become a hazard for other drivers. Cars overheat, people pull over on the side of the road and you have drivers who are still accelerating and not paying attention to the road. Just a simple feature to tell a driver to brake could do so much to help the roadways be a better place. Putting reflectors closer together on the road ways can help keep drivers in there lanes. The noise made followed with the vibration the driver feels from crossing them could help keep them more centered in the proper lane. They moved the cones closer together on the 95 express lanes to prevent drivers from crossing in and out of express lanes. I dont see it happenining like it was before with the cones being moved closer. That can be the same for the road reflectors, the noise could also alert a driver who has dozed off at the wheel and they are not in the end lanes; It will further let them know it is time to pull over.","staresha.charles001","staresha","Lee","staresha.charles001@gmail.com","USER","2018-06-16 21:31:07",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/give-back/comments#!c-ddb30680a691d157187ee1cf9e896d03"

"improving-miami-dade-traffic-and-transportation",,"Hi Aly, the routes with the most benefit up and down US1 south are the 34 and 39 express routes for the obvious reason of having limited stops. The other routes although still great options for just regular daily public transport in order to reduce traffic may be bettered by too having more limited stops. The important thing would be to have the buses depart at specific times so that those riding know exactly when they must be there by. It’s extremely unreliable if a bus route is running early (although a great  attribute) but also departs early which causes much confusion.  Something along the lines of a schedule would have to be addressed vs just an estimated arrival/departure times that is hardly ever followed. But on the other hand, I suppose that if there were indeed dedicated bus lanes it would be much easier to follow a schedule since traffic wouldn’t be a delaying factor.","marcougar01","Marco","Ugartechea","marcougar01@gmail.com","USER","2018-06-18 18:54:41",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/improving-miami-dade-traffic-and-transportation/comments#!c-cee631121c2ec9232f3a2f028ad5c89b"

"automated-destination-system-ads",,"Hello Aly, Please see replies specific to each question asked.

Do you have any examples of something like this working in other cities or was it a moment of new inspiration?

I would love to believe the idea is completely original however very unlikely.  Just a short search for the concept yielded the following:
https://patents.google.com/patent/US9129525
http://appinfoinc.com/how-does-the-glance-preemption-and-priority-system-work/
https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/advancedresearch/pubs/15085/15085.pdf

What's to motivate them to listen to this system?
Here in lies the real solution…we need behavioral scientist to solve the traffic issue.  IF quantitatively enough pathways exist for the volume of vehicles to arrive similar destinations within relatively the same time then it’s just a matter of getting the drivers to commit psychologically.

What sort of interface would drivers use to indicate their location/destination?
1.	SMS via short code with a replied “system” determined best route based on a designed algorithm.  (this is low barrier to entry and quick check for proof of concept)
I love this idea the most since can be implemented near-term using current infrastructure and doubles as a building block for future versions.  

2.	Localized data “plug-in” for existing navigation software, i.e. smartphone app or in-vehicle type.  Perhaps using vehicle registration initially to vet user interface to city wide traffic system. 

Lastly, if you do have any pictures that will help illustrate what you're describing, please upload them to the post.
I do not have any documentation to date.  It’s only conceptually in my head.

Ideally a fully autonomous system without human interaction which would almost work flawlessly once iterated.  I wholeheartedly believe all the viable components for the aforementioned systems already exists, albeit disjointed.  With enough metadata using existing municipal information, i.e. roadway types/size, DOT signage, construction schedules and district zoning can refine the system in the future.  I spent about two (2) hours reviewing current city-wide traffic control systems (TCS) and every single one is reactive in design.  If there’s a concert, why not send everyone going there in varying routes whilst redirecting all others around or away from the venue radius.

"automated-destination-system-ads",,"Craig - thanks for the detailed response! It really is an interesting idea, and I agree that folks would probably find the SMS shortcode concept to be relatively easy to integrate into their daily routines. I guess, the point that I'm left at is just difficulty imaging where one would even start.

"automated-destination-system-ads",,"Aly, I would imagine need to educate and market the tool’s availability at city agencies (DMV etc) and roadway signage.  Perhaps run a few news pieces along with mailers to anyone with registered vehicles in the jurisdiction.

“For the best traffic routes please text 511...”

Restrictions: &gt;5 miles apart

Example:
F: 4441 Collins Ave, Miami Beach, FL 33140
F: 4441 Collins Ave, Miami Beach
F: Miami Beach, FL
F: 33140

T: 2100 NW 42nd Ave, Miami, FL 33126
T: 2100 NW 42nd Ave, Miami
T: MIA Airport
T: 33126

To MIA Airport would balance the demand dynamically between RT A1A, I-195, RT 934, RT 922 and perhaps as far to RT 826.

So naturally the efficiency algorithm in the GPS takes the most direct route.  However if travelled just a bit out the way would get there faster.  The proposal would  extrapolate existing road conditions, participates or not, then route intended additional travelers to lesser populated paths.  All while using metadata like city issued permits for events, festivals, road work schedules, traffic monitors, and reports of incidents to dynamically get people to the airport.

I emailed same above response with pictures.","cbrown","Craig","Brown","cbrown@metroprise.com","USER","2018-06-22 21:20:12","2018-06-22 23:16:15","https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/automated-destination-system-ads/comments#!c-daca41214b39c5dc66674d09081940f0"

"public-transportation-would-work-so-much-better-if-there-was-more-parking-for-vehicles",,"Hi Aly. Thanks for your reply back. My commute is a 9 mile commute one way. 
Home: North Miami near Biscayne Blvd
work: downtown Miami near MDC. 
Going into work @ 7:30am, it's a 25 minute commute. Going home it's a 45 minute commute at 5pm. On the bus it estimates 50 minute,but commute plus time traveling from home to bus stop. I'm sure there are better stops that would be better but the bus I would take is a express bus that goes down Biscayne Blvd. It makes minimal stops hence the name express. Going from my home to downtown there are 17 stops. If they put a parking lot in between this commute possibly people would drive to that mini hub and get on there. Then possibly there could be less dedicated stops on the way. DOMINO EFFECT*'*Less time, more riders, less congestion, happier citizens. The stop by my house is a old Kmart lot. Massive parking lot that is not being used. I'm not saying to use the whole parking lot just a few spaces as a test pilot project. At least put a bicycle rack next to the bus stops to make it more inviting.The thing is if they start charging a pricey cost for parking, no one will use it. They have implemented this somewhat but there is few of them and no stops in-between. For example there is a 95express bus. It goes almost 200 streets with no stop in between. This was a option for me but I would have drive 60 blocks the opposite direction to get the bus.

"cut-down-on-accidents-with-safety-features-which-cuts-down-on-traffic",,"Some of Fords new and more popular models, like the Ford mustang and Fusion have a smart key feature built inside of it. The key can be programmed so that the vehicle operates with special limitation when being operated by a teenager. A spare key with a governor, All cars come with key and a spare. The key used by the teen can have restrictions to the top speed of the vehicle, No where in miami does the speed limit exceed 70 max speed. The distractions of outgoing cell phone calls and text messaging (if possible) which would greatly limit cell phone usage; Giving tickets to drivers who are texting doesn't seem to deter teens from taking the risk of doing it. Taking your eyes off the road traveling at 60 mph, a person can easily cover 1/4 of a mile. The volume level of the entertainment system while the car is being driven, which would allow a teen driver to be less distracted and more alert to their surroundings. All of those safety features can be set by the parent right from the comfort of there home on the computer. 
To make other owners participate we must advertise how great our buy back program will be, the benefits of driving a Ford, and being part of the Ford family. People are very influenced by what they see on Television and by what their neighbors/friends own. That is what helped us make the decision to buy our first ford mustang in the 90's instead of another Vehicle. Owners of other vehicles if they choose to participate, may not get the same deal as someone who is already part of the ford family and is upgrading to a newer safer vehicle, but moving forward they would be. Other owners can receive a good value for there trade in. Having an in-house financing program for people who trade in their old vehicle for a New Ford would be great if they can get a lower interest rate rather than going through an outside bank.","staresha.charles001","staresha","Lee","staresha.charles001@gmail.com","USER","2018-06-16 15:14:53",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/cut-down-on-accidents-with-safety-features-which-cuts-down-on-traffic/comments#!c-c86a7ee3d8ef0b551ed58e354a836f2b"

"how-to-improve-traffic","Hi <Urociolakes9><Lavida Esbella>&nbsp;

My name is Wilda, one of the common facilitators. 

You touched on on a few points worth diving deeper into:

1. Many residents are mentioning more rail systems? Which areas do you think this would benefit the most? What area do you live in and what’s the primary mode of transportation there?

2. What is your current mode of transportation? Has that influenced your decision to take or not take public transportation? 

3. Here on the platform, we’ve noticed many residents mention construction as a source of traffic jams. Here is a site that helps you search construction sites in Miami-Dade. I don’t know how much timing plays a factor but perhaps seeing each project’s timeline might help understand why it’s taking so long or at least who we can speak to about it:

"traffic-lights",,"It is everywhere. there isn't a single major artery without that problem. Biscayne Blvd- constant. in the evening/night with little traffic, and you are stopped for no reason at any intersection in Aventura or North Miami Beach,. the 163  bridge to Sunny Isles is another case in point. Lights get red when the intersection is the entrance into the Oleta River Park after dark when the park is closed and not a soul turns in there. Or anywhere along there - they stop traffic all the time for no reason. Sunny Isles and Surfside are both terrible along Collins - i wonder if they do it on purpose because it seems impossible to coordinate lights any worse.  Biscayne, NE 2nd, N Miami Ave - all terrible. NE 96th from Miami Shores to the I-95, also bad. i'd say Sunny ISles and Surfside both should share the awards to worst coordinated lights.  Aventura along Biscayne is next.  Aventura is very good to make money out of their red light cameras and their no right on red signs. At night, they keep people waiting at an empty intersection for several minutes, so that they might be tempted to do a right on red or else they'll fall asleep at the wheel. Not one person crossing the street, not two cars on the road.  They want people to jump the light.

"traffic-lights","This is the best idea that I have read so far.  It is absurd that this city does not have any sensors on traffic lights. Go down N Miami Avenue or any major street and you will be stopped at intersections where not one vehicle crosses for an entire minute. Viceversa, spend your night at some red light till ten minutes later you decide to just turn right and do a U turn . Lights are not coordinated and you might be stopped at a red just because the one ahead is red and backs up.  I wonder who programs the lights - they for sure do not investigate traffic patterns. That along would alleviate traffic because the goal is to move cars and not to stop them, adding to noise and pollution.  Collins at 86 I think it is, welcome to Surfside - why is Surfside stopping all the traffic from Miami Beach for a full minute, creating a terrible gridlock, even though there is no intersection there to speak of (a minor entrance to a beach parking).

Firstly, how brave if you to have taken a trip with your friend to FIU.  I’m sure you had no idea what you signed up for. I have friends who attend both campuses and by far the Modesto campus is a nightmare. The bridge that collapsed a few months ago was supposed to alleviate some of that traffic, but I can only imagine it’s made things worse since the tragedy.

I don't ever remember traffic being this much of a problem when I was growing up in Miami. Being a native from here and seeing the city change before my eyes has been surreal. The recent entrepreneurship boom has only added to the influx of new residents. 

How long have you lived in L.A.? Also, what do you think the aversion to public traffic is with residents from LA and Miami? People here really like their cars.

"more-ways",,"Hi Wilda,
It is crazy how much thr city has grown. I grew up in Coral Springs, not to far from Miami. When we were young we use to come party in Miami. The changes are wildly rapid!

Mmm, that makes sense about the growth due to the entrepreneurial boom. Thanks for sharing that perspective!

I currently live in Coconut Grove, Miami, FL ;-)

Although I personally don’t drive (I bike, walk, use public transit, and Uber), I think it has to do a lot with people being (1) attached to their cars (love there cars as you put it ;-) and (2) the experience they encounter when they  use public transit.

(1) People want to be able to go anywhere any time. Public transit is not available near my house at the drop of a hat. I have to schedule my day aroun the schedule of public transportation, instead of being able to leave my house when I am ready and perhaps waiting only a little bit for a ride. Which is why I prefer Uber!

(2) Most people taking public transit seem to be of lower socioeconomic class. I believe in compassion for all and have a practice to see  sentient being with equality (even if I do this imperfectly). But many people “don’t want to ride next to individuals of lower classes” : ( 

I did live in LA for 6 months, and notice similar patters. People want to keep their cars, even in the worst traffic conditions. They highways were congested on the time with traffic at all hours of the day. I know Miami is on track for this, is kind of already there, but it will get worse. However, I do think there is hope with millennials as we have a different view on live/work balance and how we want to spend our time and energy. Sitting in traffic is not contributing to my well-being, which is why I choose other methods to travel.

I love meeting people from all over the world when I Uber and travel on public transit. It’s Miami after all and the experience can be so much fun! It’s about perspective and I think the younger generation has it.

I agree on the above, immediate non-capital solutions. But bike rentals are usually used by vacationers on weekends. I do see the rental scooters being used by local kids. 

In the end I would love seeing more people out of their cars, but I am not sure that will be the case. We will see an increase in all the above: foot traffic, bike traffic, and car traffic. People that love their cars will continue to do so. Younger generations and immigrants may increase foot traffic, and everyday we see more and more bikes. So I think all of them need to be addresses. At some point large cost capital improvements will need to come in. It’s inevitable.

Thank you so much for engaging with me :)","tanya","Tanya","Siejhi","tanya@healsci.com","USER","2018-06-25 14:19:48",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/more-ways/comments#!c-67e103b0761e60683e83c559be18d40c"
"more-ways",,"Hi there! <Utanya><Tanya Siejhi>&nbsp;

Hi Wilda,
From Coral Springs to Coconut Grove, huh? Such beautiful neighborhoods :) My friend is moving to Coconut Grove in a few months, I'm so excited for her! She's part of the entrepreneurial boom making Miami their new home. How do we get residents excited about public transportation, especially for those with families, when the system is not so reliable? 

People DO like their cars because it represents a type of freedom. If public transportation were to run more smoothly, perhaps more of us would give it a try? 

So, I'm glad you mentioned socioeconomic status and public transportation. Perhaps the attachment to cars is seen as a status symbol and the people, that even to the detriment of the environment and increased traffic and accidents, will hold dear to those cars. How would you change that? 

Perhaps, as you mentioned, making public transportation the new 'hang out' spot which could contribute to well-being. :) 

Walkable, green neighborhoods are definitely getting some hype in the space of mobility and innovative ways of getting residents to think of transportation differently.

You are very welcome for the post. :) Nice that you like my post and I really do appreciate it that you find my post inspirational. Well, I thought about it on the spot, to be honest. However, I have done some studies on how barefooting can be both a way to bond with others and even a way to innovative with your surroundings and I thought one possible way that can work while in Miami-Dade County can be creative sensation paths outside as a way to maybe make the sidewalks and walkways more interesting.

To be honest and personally, I would really like to see a huge sensation path created in a science museum as a way to explain the science of barefooting. Here is a picture link I found in case you're not sure on what I mean by a sensation path: https://bit.ly/2MCXTzz

"sensation-paths-ai-programs-and-solar-power-vehicles",,"Hello,
I have family in London, but this each idea can be suitable for any city and not just Miami. Nice that you like the sound of sensory/sensation paths; they can be helpful for any city, to be honest; not just certain cities or countries. You can even have one as the new walkway to your flat or even in your backyard or even, as I stated here, in science museums: https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/sensation-paths-creative-sidewalks-and-walkways/comments#c-3a0772443a0739141292a5429b952fe6

One thing I found out is that they are common to be found in some European countries. I am not sure if there is one in London, but if it is still active, there is actually a barefoot park in Stoke-on-Trent, England called &quot;Trentham Gardens Barefoot Walk&quot;. Here is a link to some of the popular, and recommended, barefooting parks in Europe: http://www.barfusspark.info/en/park.htm

It is true on the hot weather and adding shady trees to an outdoor sensation park would be a great idea and even use them as relaxation stations for those who want to take a break from the walking and traveling. One addition would be adding handrails to the sites for those who are blind and interesting in going barefoot on a sensation path. Also, thank you so much for the link; it as very helpful and I will highly keep that in mind. I want to make sure ideas are new and creative while making sure if it beneficial for others who want to see something interesting in the city.","lbrooklyn99","Lew","Sterling","lbrooklyn99@gmail.com","USER","2018-06-21 23:42:12",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/sensation-paths-ai-programs-and-solar-power-vehicles/comments#!c-a9a6653e48976138166de32772b1bf40"

&quot;Besides, for those who love going/being barefoot, some of the floorings you can choose for the path, like synthetic grass or wood or even hay, are technically not going to really become hotter when in hot weather unlike cemented concrete in the summer time.&quot;
I have a simillar experience, usually when I go to the beach I go barefooted, but in the process of walking to the beach my feet get burnt  because of the cement and the road's temperature.

Thanks for applauding and congratulating my post; I always try to research and resource topics that someone does not know much about something or even express something from a different perspective with barefooting being one of those topics. Cool that you both liked my reference on the different floorings at the hot weather. Matteo, sorry to hear that happened to you by the beach; concrete is easy to make yet odd at times when barefooting on it due to the weather. Wilda, I actually never had my feet burnt or hurt or injured when barefooting; your house definitely sounds like a fun place to visit since you have a &quot;no shoes in the house&quot; rule; now if only more people did that same rule.

Cool that you, Wilda, find sensation paths a great way to get kids to go outside. Even though I am 21, I remember going to science museums a lot for school field trip. If any science museum coordinators or directors see this, then I am honestly willing to write an essay, or as a college term paper, about the science of barefooting as a way to influence them to create a huge sensation path (maybe as a huge board game if possible) as a section in the museum. You are very welcome for educating you on the idea and concept of sensation paths. Great that you find this to be a perfect idea in the idea phase; I have a lot of ideas for sensation paths as a way for innovation (not just in parks and people's front/back yards and maybe possibly in science museums) and something to be more common. 

Sure thing; I am still new to this site so I am still trying to update my account still like my profile picture (along with learning how to tag someone in a message or comment I write on here). I have many ideas in mind for where this can go for both creativity and innovation.

Nice that you really love the idea. Oh, you're high-arched because of flat shoes; I see now. If you are okay with me asking, how long have you been high-arched for? Cool that you went over to check out my Prezi and great that you found it very informative. I think improving health is another good way for improving the innovation in both not just mobility, but also in society. I have been to various places barefoot (outside homes and beaches) and they are quite relaxing, to be honest. True, despite the lack of sensation paths, it is a lot of fun and definitely something people should give a better thought about along with giving it a try themselves. If more sensation paths were made, whether in parks, science museums, or even as simple as one's backyard or the walkway to one's house, it can bring a form of innovation and creativity to understand public health through a different perspective.

Your post is really well articulated. I'm Wilda, one of the community facilitators, by the way. We could certainly find solutions for our mobility troubles by embracing technology. Because we're in the EXPLORE phase of the challenge, we are looking for the problems. We could use fresh ideas like yours but before we do, can we first identify the problem areas?

First of all I would like to apologize as my English is not as fluid and perfect as my Spanish but i promise to put all my best efforts to communicate my ideas.
Answers:
1. I see that all city areas are necessitating full improvements to reach mobility goals, I can't enumerate all here but give you some big examples.
the whole city is dis-articulated which means that in a reasonable time we can't move from any point A to any point B within the city
The existing roads and urban layout with innumerable amount of physical obstacles (closed roads to traffic, dead ends, lakes and canals, tree and landscape layouts  that has not been integrated into the mobility system make the circulation a headache. A future study and redesign of the whole existing and future urban space and layout would be necessary meanwhile in the beginning as I said identifying and solving those most neuralgic would a a good start. The means of transportation that we have despite being enough and being consistent to our development as a country of the first world are also dis-articulated and fail to motivate the citizen to make a rational and responsible use of them in their majority because they don't satisfy that basic need to transport or move people from one point of the city to another in a reasonable and practical period of time, The traffic in Miami is really a nightmare specially it doesn't provide a fast movement of vehicles and people. The public transportation system has failed to provide mobility and has also failed to make its use attractive.
I think my picture is already there let me know if this is still missing.

"inspire-well-being-in-miami-traffic-solution",,"Hi Katie!

Thank you for your response. My personal experience is actually overwhelming. There are too many cars, too many people, and too much traffic. My bicycle is my main mode of transportation, and its really stressful because I am constantly having to look both ways, ring my bell, and announce myself to both cars and pedestrians. Many cars feel they always have the right of way even In crosswalks, and pedestrians simply aren’t paying attention. Online it looks like Miami has awesome bike lanes, but we don’t. “Bike lanes” for commuting are sidewalks that are shared by both bikes and pedestrians, so its hard to get through foot traffic. Uber is great, but be prepared to be patience b/c it takes a long time to get anywhere. Which is why I prefer to bike. There are rental scooters in our area (brand names Bird and Lime) that do really well here. They are easier to navigate around pedestrian traffic, compared to a bicycle.

I see your point, there is definetly not a plan of action to what urban planning concerns, and Miami is continuing to grow it's population. 
Roadway construction plan is something harder to change as citizens, plus I think there problem lies deeper than that. 
I like the next ones you propose, driver's education is key,

What do you think are the biggest issues that people get affected when moving around the city due to the weather?
Could you eleborate a little more on the image and the wi-fi connected cars and roads please?

"crossing-is-crux",,"Hi Matteo.
Unfortunately, because nowadays people don't believe in science and sometimes even if all the facts are well documented, we need to show how the streets are working today, for at least 3 months. Record it, get all the data, and then present the alternative. Because this way they will agree that we need change.
My primary target would be in Downtown Miami. We need to implement ONE roundabout (RA) in ONE crossing and deploy all the structure (police, fire, ambulance and a lot of signs) all to show people that they really need to pay attention. After the first week, we'll only need the police to make sure all the rules are being followed (one &quot;smart&quot; person can ruin it all).
The law enforcement has to be done also with cameras, fines at first will work as warnings, no charges, but then with a huge penalty.
The real trick will be how to make people go through it, and that requires a redirection of the flow. The RA will work to redirect people around. Let's suppose all incoming traffic from I-95 goes to the RA. There they will be able to go right-direct-left without stopping.
The streets that follow must not have crossings. All traffic in a crossing must be diverted to the right lane or straight making the left turn impossible until they find a one-way street allowing them to go left.
This way the RA will be always flowing and if someone misses their entrance, they will need to go further to come back, just like in a highway.
I hope you can understand the explanation.
Feel free to contact me.

Driving in Miami is frustrating, our lights seem timed against the flow of traffic, without any coordination between them.

In fact the first time can be confusing to a driver. And you need to know which lane to be in when making the crossover. The only advantage might be when you want to make that left turn onto a highway. If you are in that left lane, as many drivers are who just want to continue straight in what they think is the fastest lane, you will find yourself in an exit only lane onto the highway.

We would have to implement more lanes than in the example so that transit does not get stoped here.

This is great information, and the sort of thing that this project may be able to help solve. Would you mind answering  a few more questions: Do you travel by bus to commute to work - or are you only talking about unusual journeys? Do you own a car too? When you say call, you mean call the bus company - or some other source of info, and finally is it the information that's online which is confusing you, or printed timetables and routes? Thanks if you can drop back in and give us a little detail.

"lighter-summer-traffic-hints-at-a-solution",,"Hi, Katie. Certainly! I've noticed lighter traffic everywhere, really. Specifically, I drive daily on N.W. 87th Ave (Galloway Road) north and south. I usually also have a pretty heavy commute to work from the Doral, Fl. area to downtown Miami on the Dolphin Expressway (836 East in the AM / West in the PM). Average time with school in the morning is 45-50 minutes, now 30-35. Lots of folks go on vacation and I'm sure that contributes to lighter traffic. But just because kids are out of school doesn't mean they are at home all day. Many still have to get dropped off somewhere while parents work. The older kids who drive are on the road. So how come traffic is not that bad then? I wonder if it has something to do with the schools' start and end times or the drop off/pick up method. That's an area that could be explored for possible solutions.","sue.arrowsmith","Sue","Arrowsmith","sue.arrowsmith@yahoo.com","USER","2018-06-26 14:01:32",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/lighter-summer-traffic-hints-at-a-solution/comments#!c-0ff39bbbf981ac0151d340c9aa40e63e"

Kids used to walk/bike to school in greater numbers but parents are disinclined to send them off nowadays.  There are a number of ways to get kids walking and biking to school again which could reduce traffic during the AM commute times, it starts with safety education.  Programs like UM's Bikesafe/Walksafe programs have made walking and biking safer for youth.  Encouraging parents to join their kids and start their day with a healthy walk/bike can reduce stress and prepare young and older minds for the day ahead.

We promise to continue to deliver on our goal which is to reduce school traffic at peak hours of school and work times.

Let's remember that we are not in the idea phase, we are still in the exploration phase so what would you say if we change the point of view of your solutions and base them in the problems that they are solving?
Like:
1.There is no flow calculations of roads and therefore the intersections are not as efficient as they could be.
2.There are too many two way roads, which adds more turns and more wait time.
3.There are not enought routes to go south, or long distances, over different time slots, based on the flow of traffic.

"towards-a-more-inclusive-tomorrow",,"Hi Wilda--

I have always made sure that I live within walking distance to my work and public transportation so my commute foibles are always negligible.  However, traffic across the MacArthur Causeway mirroring work in times of 9 to 5 is always a problem.  I did not have enough space to write in a few other suggestions for the city of tomorrow challenge--so I will elaborate on a main one here:  that city/government offices operate on a varying in/out times in differences of at least 2 hours on varying days as well.  For example: MWF in times of 7am for half of staff and 10am on TuThu, with some staff that are not seeing residents to choose 4 10hr work days and/or alternate in times of 11-7/6-2/7-3/10-6 on any day.  (Not to exceed cleaning/safety crews out times to save on electric/energy consumption in large buildings.) 

The other idea was having electric vans around in/out times for big/nearby government buildings offer shuttle service every 5-10 minutes from/to major transit hubs as outlined in original proposal.  Another was enacting legislation that would enforce any large building being built intrinsically to have a viable and user friendly public/private mass transport scheme connecting to existing transit hubs in place and to include electric charging stations, bike storage, and fleet parking.

This brings to mind the new mall that just got approved to be built--I would have demanded that it include apartment buildings subsidized by the owners with set rent rates for future workers in the mall; that it include electric van fleets to shuttle workers/consumers to/from major transit hubs; that it have plenty of electric vehicle gratis charging stations, fleet parking, bike storage; and as massive as it is, I would have demanded an elevated rail line of some sort to/from it.","adriandole","Adrian","Dole","adriandole@aol.com","USER","2018-07-03 16:48:41","2018-07-05 14:51:16","https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/towards-a-more-inclusive-tomorrow/comments#!c-01882513d5fa7c329e940dda99b12147"

The bus fare is not expensive, but if the County really wants to get people to ride, free passes would definitely get people's attention.  In Coral Gables, there is a free trolley system that is great.  The trolleys  come around about every 15 minutes; and there are no circuitous routes.

"improve-access-to-rail-and-bus-service",,"Hi Matteo,

Thank you for your reply. 

I am a little confused with the phases and the process for the City of Tomorrow Challenge. When you stated in your message... let's remember that we are in the exploration phase and we are not solving problems now... I didn't understand that.  

I thought I had carefully read the instructions and understood the rules and procedures but apparently, that is not the case. As I recall, when in the &quot;Explore&quot; phase there were three options offered and the one in the middle, the one I chose,  was &quot;Inspire Innovation.&quot;  I thought that meant to offer a solution to a problem.  So, that is what I did. But based on your reply, that is not what I should have done.

So if you would be so kind, can you briefly review what I am supposed to do and when in order to participate in the City of Tomorrow Challenge. From what you state, I believe my previous post should NOT have been in the &quot;Explore&quot; phase but should have been part of the &quot;Propose&quot; phase. How can I make the change and continue expanding on that concept as well as offer other concepts that I have in mind?

Thanks,

Thanks for your contribution!  I am Matteo, one of the facilitators here.
I hear what you are saying, you try to use public transportation. 
It is great that you live so close to your office, that is definitely a privilege. I usually have to drive 30-40 minutes to get to work, depending on traffic. 
Love your way of shifting types of mobilization to get from point A(your house) to point  B(Metro mover station) in a bike, from B to C (your office) in public transport (metro moover). I see that your pain points there are that they are not always available as expected, so there is definitely a communication issue that does not let you exploit the perfect scenario of this. 
What else can you see here that I am missing as a pain point?

"miami-trolley-trails","HI Ernest, 

I like the idea of riding along canals. I do it when there's the option as it can be relaxing (in London). Could you share a pic of what they canal-side paths look like? 

The &quot;30 mi. of FPL high tension elec. corridors, and 50 mi. of average speed railroad corridors&quot; with ample ROW all look interesting as well.",,"peter2","Peter","Hutchison","peter@100open.com","ADMIN","2018-07-09 14:39:53",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/miami-trolley-trails/comments#!c-b865367fc4c0845c0682bd466e6ebf4c"
"miami-trolley-trails",,"Peter,

Thanks! The conceptual photo shown is how a canal bank could be expanded to be a space the public could inhabit and use for recreation and transit.

If this idea makes it into the next round I'll gladly share more photos of existing conditions and proposed conceptual ideas for all three cases, along with highlighting the corridors which have enough dedicated ROW for multiple uses and could be connected to create a cohesive system across the entire county.

For now, I will say that there are some current walking rails along some parts of the canals we have in Miami but no cohesive system. The Canals which have a protected ROW are the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) managed canals which average between 30, 50, and 100 feet on one bank of the canal or both, depending on the canal. I grew up living near the Snake Creek Canal which maintains 100 feet on both banks for a majority of its length. Some municipalities along the these canal's have a pedestrian/bike path but they end at their city limits. Mainly throughout Miami-Dade County,&nbsp;these spaces are undeveloped.

The High Tension Electrical line ROW corridors which our local power utility provider, Florida Power &amp; Light (FPL) have running throughout parts of Miami Dade County, do have in some locations a park, parking lot, or golf course running underneath them, but for the majority of the FPL ROW corridors they are vacant of any planned space or trails.

Similarly, the railroad corridors which are underused, abandoned or used for freight (which in comparison to other cities in the U.S. isn't that frequent 1 to 2 trips per day) have about 30 feet of ROW which could provide alternative use access for parts of the day or 24/7. There are railroad corridors where this won't work for safety reasons, our higher-speed private rail corridor (The Brightline), has rail service that is too frequent and fast for other uses to coexist safely, and our regional public rail corridor (Tri-Rail) also has freight rail running throughout the day. Just like the FPL and SFWMD ROWs, there are efforts to convert rail corridors. For example, there is a trail/park being planned for an abandoned railroad corridor called Ludlam Trail but the planning of this corridor doesn't consider how it could add to the transportation ecosystem beyond a bike and pedestrian trail.

The greatest part of this proposal which I'd love to see happen is the adaptive reuse of the existing rapid transit system (Metrorail) rail cars. They are old, and the new rail cars being built are a needed upgrade, but I believe instead of scrapping or making artificial reefs with the old rail cars, we could repurpose them for other uses in the metropolitan area. The industrial and technological creativity of local residents paired with the innovations we've made into automation technologies could spur a new locally based industry which constantly creates and enhances automated solar-powered rail cars that could roam the county and move on demand for whoever needs them along these trails, as well as sync with other automated uses like rideshare providers, and public or private transit services. 
This could spur a whole new local cyclical industry of rail-car refurbishers, mechanics, and automation techs who love to focus on maintaining the safety of pedestrian walkers/runners, bicyclists, trail park users, and passengers.

Overall, Miami's flatness is it's greatest potential. While other U.S. and global cities were built with these ROWs operating on separated levels (whether underground or with elevated viaducts), Miami's newness (122 years), rapid growth, and apprehension to funding high-cost infrastructure could be a benefit for a low-cost investment that adds back to the community levels of quality life like this.","ernest.e.bellamy","Ernest","Bellamy","ernest.e.bellamy@gmail.com","USER","2018-07-09 21:45:23",,"https://challenges.cityoftomorrow.com/challenge/miami/explore/miami-trolley-trails/comments#!c-bf201d5407a6509fa536afc4b380577e"
